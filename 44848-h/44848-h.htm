<h2>A LITTLE PRESERVING BOOK
FOR A LITTLE GIRL</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<small>MARMALADES</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were two long and very wide shelves,
besides a good-sized bench that had a shelf underneath,
in mother's preserve closet. Before
these stood two little girls, Jessie May and Adelaide.</p>

<p>Jessie May was Adelaide's most intimate
friend, who had been away the whole summer
long. To be sure, they had written to one
another regularly, and in each letter that Adelaide
sent to Jessie May she hinted at a wonderful
secret. Now they were together again, the
one longing to hear and the other eager to tell
the wonderful secret.</p>

<p>"You see," said Adelaide, pointing proudly
to the bench and its shelf underneath, "this is
all my work, the other (indicating the two long
and very wide shelves) is mother's."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Jessie May gasped, for the top of the bench
and the underneath shelf had every spare inch
covered with jars of jams, jellies, preserves,
pickles, vegetables, etc.</p>

<p>"Why, Adelaide! You couldn't,&mdash;I mean,
how could you?" hastily corrected Jessie May,
for she wouldn't for the world have Adelaide
think she doubted her word.</p>

<p>"Well," said Adelaide, "let's go upstairs
and I'll tell you how it all happened."</p>

<p>When the two little girls were comfortably
seated on the back porch the great secret was
disclosed, and mother, busy in the kitchen, smiled
to herself at their very evident enjoyment.
Jessie May was all interest, and you may be
sure that Adelaide did not neglect even the
smallest detail. She poured out her very soul.
In fact, mother learned a good many things
that morning about her small daughter's
thoughts that she had hardly realized before,
until she overheard them being laid bare to
Jessie May.</p>

<p>Of course, Adelaide always told mother everything,
but it was usually the result of her
thoughts, and not the process of thinking.
You see, Adelaide had been trained to
think for herself, so in one way it was not surprising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
to hear her tell Jessie May that for two
or three years she had been longing to help
"preserve."</p>

<p>She told Jessie May it was the "great war"
that made her decide she surely was old enough
to begin, because she had read of so many little
girls who were helping in all sorts of ways to
"conserve" and "preserve."</p>

<p>"But," she said, "the thing that really
started me was Daddy's fondness for orange
marmalade, and his disappointment when we
came to the end of mother's supply. It was
way back last March," Adelaide continued, and
then went on to explain how mother had said
that she would make some at once, as it was the
very best month of the year to make marmalade.
At that season the "Valencia" oranges, "Mediterranean
Sweets," and Seville oranges were
on the market, all of which had the special
flavor most desirable for orange marmalade.</p>

<p>"So mother bought the oranges and lemons
and grapefruit," said Adelaide, "and then she
was so busy that she couldn't begin to make it
at once. Well, I thought Daddy ought to have
his marmalade, so I said, 'why can't I make it,
mother?' And, just think, Jessie May, mother
<i>let me</i>!" exclaimed the excited little girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Jessie May took a deep, deep breath, for during
Adelaide's recital she had hardly dared
breathe, for fear of missing a single point of
the story, and leaned back in her chair with
a long drawn sigh. She was too full for
words.</p>

<p>"The best part of it is," continued Adelaide,
"that I have all of the recipes right here, Jessie
May." (Adelaide then exhibited a small covered
wooden box that she had been carefully
guarding.)</p>

<p>Jessie May was very much interested in the
little box, and eagerly looked over the neat
little cards which the box contained, and on
which the precious directions were to be found.</p>

<p>Jessie May wanted to see the one for orange
marmalade, "Because," as she said, "it was
really the first recipe you ever tried, Adelaide."
Suddenly she exclaimed, "My goodness! did you
only use two oranges and one lemon and a grapefruit?
I shouldn't think they would make very
much."</p>

<p>"Well, they did," replied Adelaide, "they
made several small tumblers <i>full</i>, and, besides,
you will notice that all my recipes are for small
quantities, because mother did not want me to
grow tired of my work but enjoy each new recipe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
as it came along, and I most certainly did,"
she ended.</p>

<p>Then the two little girls went into the kitchen,
and Adelaide showed Jessie May the different
things she used while preserving. There were
not very many, and they were all easy to take
care of. There was the aluminum kettle, just
deep enough to hold a pint jar overflowing with
water (the pint jar was the largest sized jar
which Adelaide used) for sterilizing; a pair of
scales; a jelly bag attached to a wire frame
(which was very inexpensive), and could be
slipped on to a bowl or saucepan so that the
juice could drip slowly; a long wooden spoon;
a silver tablespoon for skimming; a silver knife
to insert in the jars to let the air bubbles rise to
the top when filled with fruit; two half-pint
glass measuring cups; a large aluminum funnel;
a small round wire rack to put in the bottom
of the saucepan to prevent the jars from touching
bottom and to allow the water to flow under
as well as over the top; a strawberry huller; a
small sharp knife; a wire strainer; a colander;
and a quart pitcher.</p>

<p>Adelaide told Jessie May that if she had forgotten
anything she would be sure to find what
was needed by referring to the proper card<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
alphabetically arranged under "Utensils" in
the precious little box.</p>

<p>When Adelaide commenced her lessons in
preserving mother said that she would find many
general rules to remember, which, if carefully
followed, saved time and expense, and brought
successful results.</p>

<p>Adelaide had sampled mother's preserves for
some few years now, even though she was not
so very old, and she knew the difference between
jams, jellies, preserves, marmalades, conserves,
etc., as far as taste was concerned, but the process
of making was the pleasure she was eagerly
anticipating. She began to feel "quite grown
up" when mother told her to write down the
following:</p>

<p>The preserve closet, where the fruit is to be
stored, should be dark, dry and cool.</p>

<p>The jars and tumblers used should be properly
sterilized. Then mother explained that to
sterilize, you washed your jars and tumblers
perfectly clean, placed them in a large pan (a
dishpan would do) of clean cold water over the
fire, and let boil gently for ten minutes. The
jars would be less likely to crack if a wire or
wooden rack was at the bottom of the pan for
the jars to rest on. Also, the jars must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
no nicks around the top, the covers must fit
perfectly, and they should be left in the boiled
water until ready to use.</p>

<p>After filling the jar to overflowing, insert a
silver knife between the sides and fruit, to let
the air bubbles rise to the top before sealing.
Always use new rubbers every year, and dip
them in boiling water before putting them
smoothly on the jar.</p>

<p>Never stand a jar where a cold draft can
reach it; let it stand over night upside down, to
be sure there is no possible chance of its leaking.</p>

<p>The fruit used should be of the best quality,
firm and not too ripe, and preserved as soon as
possible after picking, to have the finest flavor.</p>

<p>Hands, utensils, fruit, etc. should be spotlessly
clean.</p>

<p>A silver knife, fork, and spoon (or a wooden
spoon) were the best articles to use in preparing
or stirring the fruit, thus preventing discoloration.</p>

<p>Each jar should be thoroughly wiped on the
outside with a clean damp cloth and labeled before
putting away.</p>

<p>Marmalades, jams, and jellies, were sufficiently
protected if covered with a coating of
melted paraffin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>If you wanted nice clear jelly it must never
be squeezed, but allowed to <i>drip</i> through a jelly
bag made of a double thickness of cheesecloth,
or a jelly bag that you can buy attached to a
wire frame.</p>

<p>You could tell when the "jelly point" had
been reached if a little poured on to a cold
saucer began to set, or if the juice dropped as
one mass from the side of a spoon, or when two
drops ran together and fell as one from the side
of the spoon.</p>

<p>Mother thought these ten "rules and regulations"
were sufficient, and, of course, Adelaide
agreed.</p>

<p>"Mother, please do not tell Daddy that I
am going to make his marmalade for him," said
Adelaide, busily preparing to begin.</p>

<p>"No, dear, I won't," responded mother, then
added, "we'll keep it as a surprise."</p>


<h3>Orange Marmalade</h3>

<p>Mother told Adelaide to wash the oranges
and lemons thoroughly and to wipe them dry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
then, using the little sharp knife, cut the fruit
into quarters, lengthwise. This made it easy
to remove the seeds and cut out the thick parts
of each center or core. For this Adelaide used
a small, smooth board (in fact, it was the cover
of a five-pound butter box) upon which to cut
the fruit, and she sliced each quarter, peel and
all, very, very thinly across (not lengthwise
this time), then put them into a bowl until all
were ready.</p>

<p>Adelaide was surprised to find that it took
quite a long while to get these few prepared,
and was glad she had not attempted too many.</p>

<p>Next, she measured the fruit, using the glass
measuring cup, and poured the fruit into mother's
four quart aluminum saucepan. In a separate
pan Adelaide measured as many cups of
sugar as she had had of fruit. Then to each
cup of fruit Adelaide added two cups of boiling
water, covered the saucepan, and let it stand
for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>This completed her work for that day, except
for the clearing away of the things with which
she had finished.</p>

<p>The next morning Adelaide removed the cover
from the saucepan containing the fruit and put
the saucepan on the stove. While the fruit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
was coming to the boiling point, Adelaide
brought a number of tumblers from the preserve
closet. These she washed thoroughly and stood
in a large pan in which had been placed a wire
rack. Then, being covered with cold water,
they were put on the stove to be sterilized, or,
in other words, boiled. This was to kill all
germs and to prevent the spoiling of the fruit
when put away.</p>

<p>When the fruit began to boil, mother told
Adelaide to look at the clock, and then let it
boil for one hour (not too hard), or until the
peel of the oranges and lemons was very
tender. In the meantime, the sugar had been
placed at the back of the range to heat through,
and as soon as the fruit had boiled sufficiently,
the sugar was added gradually. The marmalade
was then allowed to boil until a little
dropped on a cold saucer would begin to jell.
After the sugar was added, Adelaide stirred
the mixture every few minutes with a long-handled
wooden spoon.</p>

<p>You could not always tell just how long it
would take for the marmalade to jell, as oranges
and lemons differ so, but mother said it was safer
to allow an hour, and if it was cooked in less
time you felt that so much time had been gained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the marmalade was done, the
saucepan was lifted to the back of the range.
Adelaide then took a long-handled spoon and
lifted the tumblers out of the boiling water on
to a tray, and filled them at once with the marmalade.
Mother happened to have a small
glass cup, not a regular measuring cup but
smaller, which proved the very thing with which
to dip out the marmalade.</p>

<p>As Adelaide, her cheeks flushed and eyes shining,
stood filling the tumblers with the golden
marmalade, mother said, "Well, dear, was it
worth the work (for it is a great deal of work,
you see) and effort?"</p>

<p>"Oh mother, I'm so proud and happy now,
that I've almost forgotten how hot and tired I
felt while stirring the marmalade and waiting
for it to jell," answered Adelaide.</p>

<p>Now that the marmalade was finished, it
seemed easy work to clear the things away.
Mother helped her stand the marmalade in the
sun while it set, and then Adelaide ran away to
play. Later, when it was cool, she took a
clean cloth, dipped it in hot water, and wiped
off the drops of jelly from the tops of the tumblers
and outsides, then melted some paraffin and
poured it over the top. By moving the tumblers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
gently from side to side the paraffin formed
on the sides and excluded the air.</p>

<p>Last of all, she put on the little labels and
carried all but one tumbler to the bench in
the preserve closet, which mother had told her
might be for her special use.</p>

<p>The next morning at breakfast Daddy was
very much delighted to find a jar of marmalade
before his plate, and he proceeded to help himself
generously when the hot buttered toast
was passed. He was so intent in his enjoyment
of this that Adelaide and mother could smile
at one another without being observed. When
he had quite satisfied his appetite he announced:</p>

<p>"Well, mother, there is no question about it,
you certainly do know how to make marmalade.
I've never tasted better; I only hope Adelaide
can make it as well when she grows up."</p>

<p>At that mother and Adelaide burst out laughing,
while Daddy looked surprised and questioned,
"What's the joke? There's nothing
funny about that statement that I can see."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Daddy, only, you see, I happened
to make that marmalade myself and before I
grew up," replied Adelaide.</p>

<p>Can't you just imagine how surprised and
delighted Daddy was?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Mother said that many people liked the addition
of grapefruit in their marmalade, so she
let Adelaide try</p>


<h3>Orange and Grapefruit Marmalade</h3>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">

<td align="right">One</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>This was prepared in exactly the same manner
as the previous recipe, except that Adelaide
grated the rind of the grapefruit instead of
cutting it into thin slices. The oranges, lemon,
and grapefruit were all washed thoroughly and
wiped. Adelaide cut the oranges and lemon
lengthwise into quarters, removing the seeds
and thick skin at the centers. Each quarter
was then sliced as thinly as possible with a sharp
little knife, and put into a bowl until all were
ready to be measured. The rind of the grapefruit
was grated and added to the sliced oranges
and lemon, then, after cutting the grapefruit
in halves, Adelaide removed the seeds and used
only the juice and fruit pulp, which she separated
from the little pockets with a very sharp
knife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>After measuring the prepared fruit with the
glass measuring cup and putting it into the
saucepan, Adelaide added two cups of boiling
water to each cup of fruit, then covered it and
let it stand for twenty-four hours. In another
pan Adelaide measured as many cups of sugar
as there were cups of fruit,&mdash;she remembered
the number of cups of fruit she had before adding
the water&mdash;so that all would be ready for
the next day.</p>

<p>The following morning Adelaide put the
saucepan containing the fruit on the stove to
boil, removing the cover first. When the mixture
came to the boiling point, she began to time
it and let it continue boiling gently for an hour.
This gave her time to wash the jelly tumblers,
after which she sterilized the same by placing
them on a rack in a pan of cold water deep
enough to cover them, then putting them on
the stove and bringing the water to the boiling
point. The pan of sugar was placed on the
back of the range to heat through, and when
the fruit had boiled an hour the sugar was
added.</p>

<p>After adding the sugar Adelaide stirred the
marmalade frequently, and as soon as it had
boiled another half-hour she began testing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
see if it would "jell." This she did by dropping
a little from the spoon into a cold saucer.
If it began to thicken and set, it was ready to
remove from the fire and pour into the sterilized
tumblers. These were placed on a tray in
the sun to set, and when cool, the tops and outsides
were wiped with a clean cloth dipped in
hot water to remove any marmalade that might
have been spilled in the process of filling. Then,
melting some paraffin, Adelaide poured it over
the top of the marmalade, and gently moving the
tumbler from side to side she completely covered
it with paraffin which kept out all air. Next
came the labels, and then the tumblers were
ready to be stored in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Orange and Rhubarb Marmalade</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">

</table></div>

<p>Adelaide found this marmalade much more
simple to make. The oranges and sticks of
rhubarb were thoroughly washed, the oranges
then cut into quarters lengthwise, and all seeds
and tough centers removed. After this, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
were put through the meat chopper and the
rhubarb was skinned and cut into one-half inch
pieces.</p>

<p>Putting these together, Adelaide measured
them to see how many cups of fruit she had and
emptied each cup in the saucepan. To each
cup of fruit she added one-fourth cup of cold
water, then placed them on the stove in the
saucepan to boil. When the boiling point was
reached, Adelaide noted the time and let them
boil slowly for one half-hour. Removing the
saucepan from the fire, Adelaide again measured
the contents and to each cup she added
three-fourths of a cup of sugar. These were
all put back in the saucepan and boiled slowly
until thick, then poured at once into the sterilized
tumblers, which Adelaide had previously
made ready. When cool, there followed the
usual wiping with a clean cloth dipped in hot
water, to remove any spillings while filling,
and the paraffin was melted and poured over
the top.</p>

<p>Adelaide never forgot to shake each tumbler
gently while the paraffin was still soft, as
it sealed the marmalade much more securely
from all air. Next came the labels and the removal
of tumblers to preserve closet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>


<h3>Peach Marmalade</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Peaches,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td align="right">1 dozen</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>What little girl does not love peaches? Adelaide
was no exception, and this marmalade was
very simply made.</p>

<p>First, mother told Adelaide to put the
peaches in a pan and completely cover them with
boiling water and let them stand for a minute
or two, or until the skins would slip off easily.
Pouring off the water, she then proceeded to
remove the skins with a small silver fruit knife
(a steel knife would discolor the fruit), and to
take out the stones.</p>

<p>Next, Adelaide weighed the saucepan (in
which the peaches were to be cooked) while it
was empty, and then cut the peaches into thin
slices and placed them in the saucepan. Again
the saucepan was weighed, this time containing
the peaches. The differences between the weight
of the empty saucepan and the same saucepan
containing the peaches showed Adelaide just
how much the peaches weighed, and to these she
added half their weight in sugar.</p>

<p>Mixing the fruit and sugar well together, she
put the saucepan away in a cool place until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
next day. Picking out four of the best peach
stones, she cracked them and removed the kernels.
These she scalded in boiling water and
removed the brown skins, after which they were
shredded into small pieces and added to the
sliced peaches.</p>

<p>The next morning Adelaide put the saucepan
containing the peaches on the stove to heat and
let them cook very slowly until thick and smooth,
not forgetting to stir frequently with the wooden
spoon. In the meantime, her tumblers had been
sterilized, and, as soon as the marmalade was
done, they were removed from the boiling water
and at once filled. When they were cool Adelaide
wiped them carefully, poured melted paraffin
over the top (shaking the tumbler gently
from side to side), labelled them, and carried
them away to the preserve closet.</p>

<p>Another way to make Peach Marmalade was
as follows:</p>


<h3>Peach Marmalade No. 2</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Peaches,</td>
<td align="right">1 lb.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar,</td>
<td align="right">1 lb.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Lemon (juice),</td>
<td align="right">One</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water,</td>
<td align="right">1 cup</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Adelaide scalded the peaches with boiling
water, then removed the skins. Then she cut
the peaches into small pieces, put them in the
saucepan with the water, and boiled slowly until
the fruit was thoroughly soft. Adelaide stirred
the fruit frequently with the wooden spoon.
Next she rubbed the cooked fruit through a
strainer, returned the peaches to the saucepan,
added the sugar and lemon juice, and let the
mixture cook slowly another half hour, stirring
it occasionally.</p>

<p>When the marmalade was finished she poured
it at once into the sterilized tumblers that were
ready waiting. As soon as they were cool she
wiped the tumblers clean, poured the melted
paraffin over the marmalade, labelled them, and
stored them away in the preserve closet.</p>

<p>Mother told Adelaide that she could also
make marmalade of apricots, quinces, plums,
and even prunes, in exactly the same manner.
So Adelaide tried each one in its season.</p>


<h3>Apricot Marmalade</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Apricots,</td>
<td align="right">1 lb.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar,</td>

<tr><td align="left">Water,</td>
<td align="right">1 cup</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>From the apricots Adelaide did not remove
the skins, she simply cut them in halves and
took out the stones, put them in the saucepan,
added the water, and boiled slowly until the fruit
was very soft, stirring frequently with the
wooden spoon. When sufficiently cooked she
rubbed the fruit through a wooden strainer,
put it back in the saucepan, added the sugar
and lemon juice, and let it cook slowly for
about half an hour. Adelaide stirred occasionally
to be sure that the marmalade did not
burn, and poured it at once into sterilized tumblers
when it was finished. The tops and outsides
she wiped clean when they were cool, and
then poured melted paraffin over the top of the
marmalade, and gently shook the paraffin from
side to side to make them air tight.</p>

<p>The labels were then pasted on and the tumblers
stored away in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Quince Marmalade</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Quinces,</td>
<td align="right">1 lb.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar,</td>

<tr><td align="left">Lemon (juice),</td>
<td align="right">One</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water,</td>
<td align="right">1 cup</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Mother told Adelaide to wash the quinces
thoroughly, wipe, remove blossom ends, cut in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
quarters and remove seeds, then cut in small
pieces; to put into saucepan, add water, and let
cook slowly until very tender, stirring with the
wooden spoon frequently; to then rub fruit
through a strainer, return to saucepan, add
sugar and lemon juice, and cook slowly one
half-hour. This she did, and when the quinces
were properly cooked, Adelaide poured them at
once into the sterilized tumblers she had ready
waiting, and put them on a tray to cool.</p>

<p>Then mother told her to wipe the tops and
outsides clean, cover with melted paraffin
(shaking gently from side to side), label, and
store away in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Plum Marmalade</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Plums,</td>
<td align="right">1 lb.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar,</td>

<tr><td align="left">Lemon (juice),</td>
<td align="right">One</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water,</td>
<td align="right">1 cup</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Adelaide first wiped the plums and removed
the stones, then put the fruit into a saucepan,
added the water and cooked until very soft, stirring
every little while with the wooden spoon.
Next she rubbed the fruit through a strainer,
returned it to saucepan, added the sugar and
lemon juice, and cooked slowly one half-hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The sterilized tumblers were waiting, and into
these Adelaide poured the marmalade. When
the jars were cool she wiped the tumblers clean,
poured over melted paraffin, shook gently from
side to side to make them air tight, added the
labels, then stored them away in the preserve
closet.</p>

<p>When Adelaide came to the prunes mother
wondered what would happen, for Adelaide did
not like prunes. It had been a tender subject
between them for some time. However, the results
were better than mother had expected, for
Adelaide remarked: "Well, mother, I may as
well try it, because even if I don't like prunes,
you do, so I'll make this marmalade especially
for you."</p>


<h3>Prune Marmalade</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Prunes,</td>

<tr><td align="left">Lemon (juice),</td>
<td align="right">One</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water,</td>
<td align="right">1 cup</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The prunes, mother said, would have to be
thoroughly washed in several waters, then
soaked over night in the cup of water. This
Adelaide did, and the next morning put them
on the stove in her little saucepan to boil until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
thoroughly cooked. With two silver forks Adelaide
then removed the stones and rubbed the
fruit through a strainer; returning the fruit
to the saucepan, she added the sugar and lemon
juice, cooked it slowly one half-hour, poured
into sterilized tumblers, and let cool.</p>

<p>When cold, Adelaide wiped each tumbler,
poured melted paraffin over the top of marmalade,
shook gently from side to side to exclude
all air, pasted on the labels, and stored
away in the preserve closet.</p>

<p>Apple marmalade came next, and mother
thought that that was sufficient for the present.</p>


<h3>Apple Marmalade</h3>


<div class="center">

<tr><td align="left">Water</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>These were nice tart apples of fine flavor.
Adelaide washed them well, cut into quarters
(removing stem and blossoms only), put in
saucepan, and added enough water to almost,
though not quite, cover the apples. These she
cooked slowly until very soft, then pressed them
through a strainer. She next measured the
fruit, returned it to the saucepan, and to each
cup of fruit added three-fourths of a cup of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
sugar. Returning the saucepan to the fire,
Adelaide let it boil gently for three-quarters of
an hour, stirring every little while.</p>

<p>The sterilized tumblers were ready, and into
these Adelaide poured the marmalade; when
cool she wiped the tops and outsides clean,
poured melted paraffin over the marmalade,
shook the tumblers from side to side gently to
exclude all air, pasted on the labels, and stored
away in the preserve closet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<small>JAMS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> course Adelaide did not make her jams,
jellies, etc., in the order given, but according to
the season, and she welcomed each fruit in its
turn. Adelaide was especially fond of jams;
they did make the most delicious sandwiches
when she came home hungry from school or went
on a picnic, but the climax of enjoyment was
reached when mother made rolly-polly jam puddings
in the winter.</p>

<p>Strawberries were usually first on the market,
and so "Strawberry Jam" was the first attempt
in the jam making line.</p>


<h3>Strawberry Jam</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Strawberries,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td align="right">1 quart</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Mother told Adelaide to empty the strawberries
into the colander and place in a pan of cold
water, then to dip the colander up and down so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
as to thoroughly cleanse the berries; next to
change the water two or three times until it was
clear, then lift out the colander and drain.
Mother also said that you should never wash
berries after they were hulled, because if you did
you lost part of the juice.</p>

<p>After Adelaide felt sure they were clean, and
after mother had carefully inspected them, she
commenced to hull the berries, using the strawberry
huller, then she weighed the berries and
measured out three-fourths their weight in
sugar.</p>

<p>With a wooden potato masher Adelaide
mashed the berries in the saucepan and poured
over the sugar; this mixture she let stand a few
minutes before putting the saucepan on the stove
and letting it come slowly to the boiling point.
When the fruit had cooked slowly for forty-five
minutes, Adelaide stirring frequently, meanwhile,
with the wooden spoon, it was ready for
her to pour into sterilized tumblers, which she
had previously prepared. The tops and outsides
of the tumblers she wiped with a clean cloth
as soon as the jam had cooled, then poured
melted paraffin over the jam, and shook gently
from side to side to make it air tight.</p>

<p>Adelaide was always glad when it came time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to paste on the neat little labels and put the
tumblers away in the preserve closet; she was
very much surprised, too, to see how quickly
her bench was becoming filled.</p>

<p>In the beginning, mother had told her that
sometimes it would seem as though she spent
all of her time preserving, for the fruits and
vegetables followed fast upon one another, but
Adelaide replied she was sure she would not
mind, she was so eager to learn.</p>


<h3>Raspberry Jam</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Raspberries,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td align="right">1 quart</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Adelaide picked over the raspberries before
washing them, and mother told her to keep a
sharp look-out for little worms that sometimes
curled themselves up in the center, and you may
be sure Adelaide's keen eyes never missed one
if there were any. Next she put them in the
colander, and then dipped the colander up and
down in a pan of clear cold water several times.
When all possible dirt had been washed away,
Adelaide stood the colander to drain, after
which she poured the berries into the saucepan
and weighed them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Adelaide found it a great convenience to
know the weight of each saucepan she used,
and she kept a little card showing just how
much each one weighed, then when they were
weighed with the fruit, all she needed to do was
to subtract the weight from the total of the
saucepan to find out how much the fruit weighed.</p>

<p>To each pound of raspberries Adelaide measured
three-fourths of a pound of sugar, then
she mashed the berries, added the sugar, and let
the mixture stand a short time before putting
it on the stove to cook.</p>

<p>When the fruit had become heated to the boiling
point, Adelaide let it cook slowly for forty-five
minutes, not forgetting to stir with the
wooden spoon to keep from burning; meanwhile,
she had sterilized the tumblers and they were
ready when the jam had finished cooking.
Adelaide poured the jam into the tumblers at
once, and as soon as it had cooled she wiped the
tops and outsides carefully, poured melted paraffin
over the jam, shook it gently from side to
side to make it secure from the air, pasted on
the labels, and stored them away in the preserve
closet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>


<h3>Raspberry and Red Currant Jam</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">

<td align="right">1 quart</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Red Currants,</td>
<td align="right">1 pint</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>First, Adelaide picked over the raspberries
very carefully and placed them in the colander,
then she removed the stems from the currants and
added them to the raspberries. These she then
dipped in clear cold water several times and set
aside to drain. Next she weighed the fruit, and
to each pound she added a pound of sugar.</p>

<p>She mashed the fruit well with the wooden
masher in the saucepan and poured over the
sugar. After a few minutes the juice began
to run and she put the saucepan on the stove,
letting the jam heat slowly through. When it
boiled, Adelaide stirred it frequently and let it
cook forty-five minutes. It was then ready to
pour into the sterilized tumblers. When cold,
she wiped the top and outside of each tumbler,
poured melted paraffin over the jam, shook it
gently from side to side, thus excluding all air,
pasted on the labels and put away in the preserve
closet.</p>

<p>This combination of raspberries and red currants
was a great favorite with everybody.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>


<h3>Red Currant Jam</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Red Currants,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td align="right">1 quart</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The red currants Adelaide removed from their
stems and put in the colander to be thoroughly
washed. This was done by dipping the colander
up and down in a pan of clear cold water.
If they were very dusty, she changed the water
several times.</p>

<p>After draining the currants sufficiently, she
weighed them and put them into the saucepan.
To each pound of fruit Adelaide added one
pound of sugar. With the wooden masher she
mashed the currants and stirred them well with
the sugar.</p>

<p>Putting the saucepan on the stove, she let
the fruit come slowly to the boiling point, stirring
with the wooden spoon frequently to prevent
it from burning. It boiled gently for forty-five
minutes, then Adelaide poured it into
sterilized tumblers at once and stood them away
to cool. When they were cold she wiped the
top and outside of each tumbler, poured melted
paraffin over the jam, shaking it gently from
side to side to keep out any air, pasted on the
labels and stored away in the preserve closet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>


<h3>Black Currant Jam</h3>


<div class="center">

<tr><td align="left">Black Currants,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td align="right">1 quart</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Adelaide found that when she used red currants,
the picking off of the stems consumed a
lot of time, so she was glad to find the black
currants come already stemmed.</p>

<p>Putting the black currants in the colander,
she proceeded to wash them thoroughly by dipping
the colander up and down in a pan of clear
cold water several times. If they were very
dusty she changed the water two or three times
until it was clear. After weighing the currants
she poured them into a saucepan, mashed them
with the wooden masher, added an equal weight
of sugar, mixed well with the wooden spoon,
let stand until the juice ran, then put the saucepan
on the stove and let the mixture come slowly
to the boiling point, stirring occasionally.
While this was boiling gently for forty-five minutes,
Adelaide sterilized the tumblers, not forgetting,
however, to stir the jam frequently.</p>

<p>When it was cooked she poured the jam at
once into the tumblers and let it cool; as soon
as it was cold, Adelaide wiped each tumbler
thoroughly, inside the top and on the outside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
poured melted paraffin over the jam, which she
shook gently from side to side to keep out all
air, then pasted on the labels and stored away
in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Blackberry Jam</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Blackberries,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td align="right">2 quarts</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Mother explained to Adelaide that the flavor
of the blackberry was delicious, but you did not
enjoy it so much if the seeds were allowed to
remain, so that jam was prepared a little differently.</p>

<p>After picking the blackberries over carefully,
Adelaide put them in the colander, then dipped
it up and down in a pan of cold water and set
aside to drain. Afterwards, she put the fruit
in the saucepan and with the wooden masher
mashed it well. Then she stood the saucepan
over the fire and let the fruit come gradually
to the boiling point. While she let the fruit
boil gently for twenty minutes, Adelaide stirred
frequently, using the long wooden spoon.</p>

<p>Moving the saucepan from the fire, Adelaide
then rubbed the fruit through a fine sieve
(mother said if the sieve let the seeds pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
through to use a cheesecloth bag) and measured.
To each cup of juice, which she returned
to the saucepan, she added three-fourths
of a cup of sugar, and putting the jam back
over the fire, let it heat slowly, stirring often.
This took three-quarters of an hour of gentle
boiling before it was done.</p>

<p>Adelaide poured at once into the sterilized
tumblers, which were waiting to be filled, and
set aside to cool. When cold, she wiped the
tops and outsides carefully with a damp cloth,
poured melted paraffin over the jam, shaking
it gently from side to side, thus keeping out all
air, pasted on the labels, and stored the jars
away in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Gooseberry Jam</h3>

</table></div>

<p>"The jams with a nice tart flavor," Adelaide
said, "are the ones Daddy likes best."
He was especially fond of gooseberry jam and
for that reason Adelaide decided to surprise
him.</p>

<p>The gooseberries Adelaide put in the colander
and dipped up and down in a pan of clear
cold water until thoroughly clean, then she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
drained them. With the strawberry huller she
pulled off the tops, though she could have used
the little sharp knife; next she weighed the
gooseberries and put them in the saucepan to
be mashed with the wooden masher.</p>

<p>To each pound of fruit she added a pound
of sugar, placed the saucepan over the fire and
let the fruit come slowly to the boiling point.
This needed to be stirred with the wooden spoon
occasionally, but after it had reached the boiling
point Adelaide stirred it very frequently
to prevent burning. It took three-quarters of
an hour to cook, and then Adelaide filled the
sterilized tumblers with the jam and set it aside
to cool. When the jam was cold she wiped
each tumbler around the top and on the outside
with a clean damp cloth, poured melted paraffin
over the jam, pasted on the labels and stored
away in the preserve closet.</p>

<p>Of course Daddy was very much pleased with
this jam.</p>


<h3>Large Blue Plum Jam</h3>

</table></div>

<p>The large blue plums, Adelaide's mother said,
made delicious jam. Adelaide washed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
wiped each plum carefully, then slit each one
with a silver knife and took out the stone.
After weighing them and putting the plums in
the saucepan she added three-fourths of a pound
of sugar to each pound of fruit, letting them
stand until the juice ran. Placing the saucepan
over the fire, she stirred the fruit occasionally
until it reached the boiling point, after
which she let it boil slowly, for forty-five minutes,
and continued to stir very frequently to
prevent the jam from burning or sticking to
the bottom. In the meantime, Adelaide had
the tumblers sterilized and waiting, and as
soon as the jam had finished cooking she poured
it at once into the tumblers. When the jam
was cold she wiped the top and outside of each
tumbler with a clean damp cloth and poured
melted paraffin over the jam, shaking it gently
from side to side to exclude all air. Next came
the labels, and then the tumblers of jam were
stored away in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Green-Gage Plum Jam</h3>


<div class="center">

<tr><td align="left">Plums,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td align="right">1 dozen</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>The green-gage plums, Adelaide found, came
later in the season, but they were worth waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
for. These she cut open with a silver knife,
after having washed and wiped them carefully,
and removed the stones. Weighing the plums,
she put them in the saucepan, and to each pound
of fruit she added three-quarters of a pound of
sugar. When the juice began to run she placed
the saucepan over the fire, and let the jam come
slowly to the boiling point, stirring it every
little while; continuing to cook the jam for
forty-five minutes, Adelaide stirred frequently
to prevent its sticking to the bottom and becoming
burned. As soon as the jam had cooked
sufficiently she poured it into the sterilized
tumblers which were ready, and when the jam
was cold, Adelaide wiped the tops and outsides
of the tumblers with a clean damp cloth, poured
melted paraffin over the top, and shook gently
from side to side to exclude all air. The labels
were next pasted on, and the jam was then
stored away in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Damson Plum Jam</h3>


<div class="center">

<td align="right">1 quart</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water,</td>
<td align="right">2 tablespoons</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Compared to the large blue plums and the
green-gage plums Adelaide found the damson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
plums quite small, and mother told her they
would have to be cooked first before she could
remove the stones easily. So Adelaide washed
the Damson plums carefully, and with a silver
knife slit each one before putting them into
the saucepan. This was to let the juice run.
But, first, Adelaide measured two tablespoons
of cold water into the saucepan, then poured in
the plums. Of course she had weighed the plums
as usual, and also an equal amount of sugar,
but the sugar she placed in a bowl and placed
on one side until ready to use. The saucepan
was then placed over the fire and the plums
were cooked slowly until tender, when they were
removed, and with two silver forks Adelaide
easily picked out the stones. Adding the sugar,
she returned the saucepan to the fire, and while
it was coming to the boiling point she stirred
constantly with a wooden spoon, so that the
sugar would not stick to the bottom and burn.
Still continuing to stir, she let the jam cook
slowly for forty-five minutes.</p>

<p>The tumblers had been sterilized and the jam
was poured into them at once. After the jam
was cold Adelaide wiped the top and outside of
each tumbler with a clean damp cloth, then
poured melted paraffin over the top, and shook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
gently from side to side to exclude the air,
pasted on the labels and stored the jars away
in the preserve closet.</p>

<p>There were many other kinds of plums, but
these were the ones that had the best flavors,
mother said, and quite enough for Adelaide to
experiment with for the present.</p>


<h3>Barberry Jam</h3>

</table></div>

<p>Barberries make a very tasty jam. Adelaide
put them in the colander, which she dipped up
and down in a pan of clean cold water until
free from all dust, then carefully picked them
over. Into the saucepan she poured one-half
a cup of cold water, then added the barberries.
Placing the saucepan over the fire, she let the
barberries become just warm, then Adelaide
pressed the fruit through a wire strainer and
measured. To each cup of fruit she added a
cup of sugar, which she returned to the saucepan,
placed over the fire, let it heat gradually
to the boiling point, then cooked twenty minutes,
stirring constantly with the wooden spoon.
The sterilized tumblers were waiting, and into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
these Adelaide poured the jam. When the jam
was cold she wiped the tops and outsides with a
clean damp cloth, poured melted paraffin over
the jam, shaking it gently from side to side to
exclude all air, then pasted on the labels and
stored jam away in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Rhubarb and Fig Jam</h3>

<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>An English friend gave this recipe to Adelaide,
and it proved to be very "tasty."</p>

<p>The friend said to choose the pretty pink
rhubarb, then wash and wipe it thoroughly, and
cut with a sharp knife into one-inch pieces.
The figs were looked over carefully and Adelaide
cut out the hard little part near the stem,
then she put them through the meat chopper
and added them to the rhubarb. When she
had weighed the prepared fruit and put it into
the saucepan she poured over it three-fourths
its weight of sugar, and let the mixture stand
until the juice ran. Placing the saucepan over
the fire, she let the fruit come slowly to the boiling
point, stirring with a wooden spoon occasionally.
After it had boiled Adelaide stirred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
it frequently and cooked gently three-quarters
of an hour. It was then ready to pour into the
sterilized tumblers, which Adelaide never failed
to have on hand, and stood away to cool.</p>

<p>When it was cool she wiped the top and outside
of each tumbler with a clean damp cloth,
poured melted paraffin over the jam, shaking it
gently from side to side to exclude all air, then
pasted on the labels and stored the jam away
in the preserve closet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<small>JELLIES</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> mother gave Adelaide her first lesson
in jelly making, Adelaide had visions. Jelly
rolls, thin bread and butter sandwiches with
jelly in between, soft boiled custards served in
individual glasses with a spoonful of jelly on
top, and many many other delicious dainties it
would take too long to tell about passed before
her active little mind. For some years now,
Adelaide's mother had been using a small thin
glass for her red currant jelly, and any other
jelly of which she was especially choice. A
glass measuring cup full of jelly was sufficient
to fill three of these dainty glasses, and the
beauty of these lay in the fact that you could
put them on the table as they were. One little
glass was sufficient to serve as a relish with cold
meat or chicken for a family of four.</p>

<p>Mother thought that as Adelaide's quantities
were all small she would let her use these small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
glasses exclusively for her jellies. Adelaide
was delighted, and often held the little glasses
up to the sunlight to see how clear and attractive
the jelly was.</p>


<h3>Red Currant Jelly</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Red Currants,</td>
<td align="right">1 quart</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water,</td>
<td align="right">2 tablespoons</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The large cherry currants were the ones
mother bought, and she told Adelaide that they
made the most delicious jelly. Adelaide emptied
the currants into the colander, which she
dipped up and down in a pan of clear cold water
until the currants were thoroughly cleansed,
then she drained them.</p>

<p>Picking them over but not removing the
stems, Adelaide poured a few at a time into the
saucepan (which contained two tablespoons of
cold water), and mashed them with the wooden
potato masher; this she continued to do until
all the currants were used.</p>

<p>Placing the saucepan over the fire, she let the
currants cook slowly until they looked white,
stirring occasionally with the wooden spoon to
prevent burning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The little jelly bag attached to the wire
frame fitted nicely over another large saucepan,
and into this bag Adelaide poured the currants,
letting them stand until all the juice had
dripped.</p>

<p>Now she measured the juice and returned it
to the original saucepan, which had been washed
clean. Again she placed the saucepan over
the fire and brought the juice to the boiling
point; then she let it continue to boil rapidly
for twenty minutes (mother said it was not
necessary to stir this).</p>

<p>When Adelaide measured the juice she also
measured to each cupful a cup of sugar. This
she placed in an earthenware dish at the back of
the range, or in the oven with the door open, to
let it heat through gradually but not to brown.
As soon as the juice had boiled sufficiently she
added the heated sugar gradually and stirred
with the wooden spoon until it was all dissolved;
when it again came to the boiling point it jellied
in about three minutes.</p>

<p>Adelaide worked very quickly now; she removed
the saucepan from the fire, skimmed the
jelly, poured it into a pitcher, and from there
into the little sterilized glasses. These she
placed in the sun and let them stand until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
next day; they were then wiped around the
tops and outsides carefully with a clean damp
cloth, the jelly was covered with melted paraffin,
the glass being shaken gently from side to
side to exclude all air. Next came the labels,
and then the jelly was stored away in the
preserve closet. It was a beautiful color,
and it made Adelaide's mouth water just to
look at it.</p>

<tr><td align="left">Water,</td>
<td align="right">2 tablespoons</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The red and white currants Adelaide found
made the jelly a beautiful color and more delicate
in flavor. These she washed carefully in
the colander by dipping it up and down in a
pan of clear cold water, then she picked them
over without removing the stems. Into the
saucepan she measured two tablespoons of
water, added the currants a few at a time, and
mashed them with the wooden potato masher
until all were used. Next the saucepan was
placed over the fire and the currants boiled until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the red currants looked white. Adelaide did
not forget to stir with the wooden spoon to prevent
the currants from burning.</p>

<p>The jelly bag was ready and into this Adelaide
poured the currants. She let the juice
drip overnight, and the next morning measured
it into the saucepan. To each cup of juice
she measured a cup of sugar, which she placed
in an earthenware dish on the back of the range
to heat through, but not to brown. The juice
Adelaide boiled for twenty minutes rapidly, then
she added the sugar very gradually and stirred
until it was dissolved. When it came to the
boiling point it "jellied" very quickly, and
Adelaide skimmed it, poured it into a pitcher,
then into the small glasses at once, which were
already sterilized.</p>

<p>Standing them in a sunny window she let them
remain until the next day. With a clean damp
cloth she wiped the top and outside of each
glass carefully, poured melted paraffin over
the jelly, shook each glass gently from side to
side to exclude the air, pasted on the labels
and, as usual, stored the jelly away in the preserve
closet.</p>

</table></div>

<p>Of all the jellies this was mother's favorite.</p>

<p>Adelaide picked over the raspberries (looking
in each centre to be sure there were no little
worms), poured them into the colander, dipped
them up and down in a pan of clear cold water
to cleanse thoroughly, and after draining emptied
them into the saucepan with two tablespoons
of cold water. The currants were
washed in the same manner as the raspberries,
and Adelaide picked them over but did
not remove the stems. These were added to
the raspberries, and she mashed them all with the
wooden potato masher.</p>

<p>Setting the saucepan over the fire, she stirred
well with the wooden spoon, and, when the fruit
boiled, Adelaide let it cook until the currants
looked white. The jelly bag was ready, and
Adelaide poured in the fruit and the juice
dripped over night.</p>

<p>When she measured the juice into the saucepan
she also measured an equal amount of sugar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
into an earthenware dish. This Adelaide stood
on the back of the range to heat through but
not brown.</p>

<p>While the juice came to the boiling point Adelaide
attended to the sterilizing of the little
glasses.</p>

<p>As soon as the juice had boiled rapidly for
twenty minutes Adelaide added the sugar gradually,
stirring constantly until the sugar was
dissolved. It very quickly boiled again and in
a few minutes reached the "jelly point." Adelaide
skimmed it carefully and poured it into a
pitcher. It was then easy to pour the jelly into
the small glasses and stand it in the sun to
set.</p>

<p>The next morning Adelaide wiped each glass
carefully with a damp cloth around the top and
outside, then she poured melted paraffin over
the jelly, shaking it gently from side to side to
exclude all air. Next the labels were pasted on,
and then the jelly was stored away in the preserve
closet.</p>


<h3>Blackberry Jelly</h3>

<p>Adelaide picked the blackberries very carefully
into the colander. This she dipped up
and down in a pan of clear cold water several
times to thoroughly cleanse the berries. When
they were well drained she poured them into the
saucepan with two tablespoons of cold water,
and mashed the berries with the wooden potato
masher. Placing the saucepan over the fire,
she let the blackberries heat through slowly until
they were soft, then she poured them into the
jelly bag and the juice dripped all night. The
next morning she measured the juice, and to
each cup she allowed three-fourths of a cup
of sugar. The juice she put over the fire to
boil rapidly for twenty minutes, and stood the
sugar in an earthenware dish at the back of the
range to heat through, but not brown. After
the juice had boiled sufficiently Adelaide added
the sugar gradually and stirred with a wooden
spoon until it was all dissolved, then she let it
boil until it reached the jelly point. Skimming
it carefully, she then poured the jelly into the
pitcher, and from there into the small sterilized
glasses, which she stood in a sunny window
to set.</p>

<p>When cold, Adelaide wiped each glass carefully
around the top and outside, and poured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
melted paraffin over the top of the jelly, shaking
it gently from side to side to exclude all
air; then she pasted on the labels and stored
away in the preserve closet.</p>

<p>The blackberries Adelaide picked over carefully
and put in the colander to wash thoroughly
by dipping them up and down several
times in a pan of cold water. After they were
well drained she poured them into a saucepan
with two tablespoons of cold water, and mashed
them with the wooden potato masher. Placing
the saucepan over the fire, she let the blackberries
simmer until they were soft, then poured
them into the jelly bag to drip. To each cup
of juice she measured a cup of sugar which she
stood on the back of the range in an earthenware
dish to heat through, but not brown, also
one-fourth of an ounce of ground cinnamon,
one-eighth of an ounce of ground mace, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
one-fourth of a teaspoonful of ground cloves,
which she tied up in a piece of thin muslin.
The juice and spices were then boiled together
rapidly for twenty minutes, after which time
Adelaide took out the bag of spices and added
the sugar gradually, stirring constantly with
a wooden spoon until the sugar was dissolved.</p>

<p>When the "jelly point" was reached she
skimmed it at once and poured the jelly into
a pitcher. It was then easy for her to fill the
sterilized glasses and let the jelly stand until
cold. Next, Adelaide wiped each glass with
a damp cloth around the top and outside,
poured melted paraffin over the jelly, shook it
gently from side to side to exclude all air,
pasted on the labels and stored away the jelly
in the preserve closet.</p>

<p>Mother said that this was better than any
medicine.</p>

<p>Black currant jelly, mother told Adelaide,
was what <i>her</i> mother gave her when she was a
little girl if ever she complained of a sore throat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
After Adelaide had tasted it she said, "Mother,
I should think you would have felt almost glad
to have a sore throat, it is so good."</p>

<p>The black currants Adelaide picked over
and washed thoroughly in the usual way by
pouring them into the colander, then dipping
it up and down several times in a pan of clear
cold water. After draining them well, she
emptied them into the saucepan, added two
tablespoons of cold water, mashed well with the
wooden potato masher, and placed the mixture
over the fire to simmer until soft. Into the
jelly bag they went next, and Adelaide let the
juice drip all night.</p>

<p>Next morning she measured the juice and an
equal amount of sugar, which she placed in an
earthenware dish at the back of the range, to
heat through but not brown. The juice she
brought to the boiling point and it continued
to boil rapidly for twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Adding the sugar gradually, she stirred with
the wooden spoon until it was all dissolved and
cooked to the "jelly point." After skimming
the jelly Adelaide poured it into a pitcher and
from there into the sterilized small glasses, and
then stood the tumblers in a sunny window.
When the jelly was cold she wiped the top and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
outside of each glass with a damp cloth, poured
melted paraffin over the jelly, and shook gently
from side to side to exclude all air. Pasting
on the labels, Adelaide then stored the jelly away
in the preserve closet.</p>

two tablespoons of cold water into the
saucepan, added the gooseberries and mashed
them with the wooden potato masher.</p>

<p>Placing the saucepan over the fire she let the
gooseberries simmer until they were soft, not
forgetting to stir with the wooden spoon to
keep them from burning. Pouring the fruit
into the jelly bag came next, and Adelaide let
it drip over night.</p>

<p>To each cup of juice Adelaide added three-fourths
of a cup of sugar. The sugar was
placed in an earthenware dish at the back of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Placing the saucepan over the fire, she let
the cherries simmer until they were soft, stirring
occasionally to prevent burning, after which she
poured the fruit into the jelly bag and let the
juice drip over night.</p>

<p>The next morning she measured the juice,
and to each cup she measured three-fourths of
a cup of sugar. The sugar she placed in an
earthenware dish and stood on the back of the
range to heat through but not burn.</p>

<p>The juice she let boil rapidly twenty minutes,
added the heated sugar gradually, and stirred
with the wooden spoon until all was dissolved.
After the juice and sugar had boiled to the
"jelly point" Adelaide skimmed it carefully,
poured quickly into a pitcher and then into the
sterilized small glasses.</p>

<p>Mother liked to have all of her jelly stand in
the sun if possible, so Adelaide stood the glasses
in a sunny window.</p>

<p>When the jelly was cold she wiped the tops

picked them over carefully, pinched each grape
to break the skin, and dropped them into the
saucepan containing two tablespoons of cold
water.</p>

<p>Placing the saucepan over the fire, she let
the grapes simmer until soft, stirring occasionally
to prevent burning, then poured them into
the jelly bag to drip over night.</p>

<p>In the morning she measured the juice and an
equal amount of sugar. The saucepan containing
the juice she placed over the fire that the
juice might boil rapidly for twenty minutes, and
the sugar was put in an earthenware dish and
stood at the back of the range to heat through,
but not brown.</p>

<p>The small glasses were all sterilized, and as

<p>The wild plums that Adelaide used were
brought to her by a friend who lived in the
country. They were about the size of large
cherries. The flavor of the jelly was most delicious
and a general favorite with everybody.</p>

<p>Adelaide washed the plums after emptying
them into the colander, by dipping the colander
up and down several times in a pan of clear cold
water, after which she drained them. Into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
saucepan she had measured two tablespoons of
cold water, and as she picked over the plums
she slit each one with a silver knife and dropped
it into the waiting saucepan.</p>

<p>These she let simmer until soft and mushy,
not forgetting to stir occasionally to keep them
from burning, then poured the fruit into the
jelly bag to drip over night. In the morning
Adelaide measured the juice, and to each cup
she measured three-quarters of a cup of sugar.
The juice she let boil rapidly for twenty minutes,
while the sugar was stood at the back of
the range in an earthenware dish to heat
through, but not brown.</p>

<p>When the juice had boiled sufficiently, Adelaide
added the sugar gradually and stirred with
the wooden spoon until it was all dissolved. As
soon as the "jelly point" was reached, Adelaide
skimmed it quickly, poured it into a pitcher,
from there into the sterilized small glasses, and
stood them in a sunny window. After the jelly
was cold she wiped each glass around the top
and on the outside with a damp cloth, poured
melted paraffin over the jelly, shaking it gently
from side to side to exclude all air, pasted on
the labels and stored the tumblers away in the
preserve closet.</p>

<p>Adelaide wiped and picked over the Damson
Plums, and slit each one with a silver knife before
placing them in the saucepan with two
tablespoons of cold water. These she let boil
until very soft, stirring occasionally with the
wooden spoon to prevent burning. When the
fruit had cooked sufficiently, she poured it into
the jelly bag and let it drip over night. The
next morning she measured the juice, and to
each cup she measured three-fourths the amount
of sugar. It (the juice) was boiled rapidly for
twenty minutes, while the sugar stood on the
back of the range in an earthenware dish to
heat through, but not brown.</p>

<p>After twenty minutes of boiling for the juice,
the sugar was added gradually and stirred until
it was all dissolved. When the "jelly point"
was reached Adelaide skimmed the jelly quickly,
poured it into a pitcher, and from there into
the sterilized glasses, and then stood them in
a sunny window.</p>

<p>As soon as the jelly was cold, Adelaide wiped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the tops and outsides of each glass with a damp
cloth, poured melted paraffin over the jelly,
shaking it gently from side to side to exclude
all air, pasted on the labels and stored the jelly
glasses away in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Apple Jelly</h3>

<td align="right">1 dozen</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>The apples that made the best jelly, mother
told Adelaide, were the "porter apples," the
"gravenstein apples," the "maiden's blush,"
and the "fall pippins."</p>

<p>Adelaide wiped each apple thoroughly with a
damp cloth and removed the stems and blossom
ends. With a silver knife she cut them in
quarters. Placing them in the saucepan, she
added cold water until it came nearly to the top
of the apples.</p>

<p>Covering the saucepan, she stood it over the
fire and let the apples cook slowly until they
were very soft. She found it necessary to stir
the fruit with a wooden spoon occasionally to
prevent the juice from burning. When it was
done Adelaide poured it into the jelly bag and
let the juice drip over night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning she measured the juice,
and to each cup she measured a cup of sugar,
which she placed in an earthenware dish on the
back of the range to heat through but not burn.</p>

<p>As soon as the juice had boiled rapidly for
twenty minutes, Adelaide added the sugar a
little at a time, stirring constantly until it had
all dissolved. Then she let it cook to the "jelly
point," after which she skimmed it quickly,
poured it into a pitcher and filled the sterilized
small glasses at once. The glasses were then
placed in a sunny window, and, when cold, Adelaide
wiped each glass around the top and on the
outside with a damp cloth, poured melted paraffin
over the jelly, shook it gently from side to
side to exclude air, pasted on the labels and
stored the jelly away in the preserve closet in
the space allotted for jellies.</p>


<h3>Crab Apple Jelly</h3>


<div class="center">

<td align="right">2 dozen</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>The crab apples make a very handsome jelly,
and as they are very small, mother did not think
two dozen would be too many for Adelaide to
prepare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>These, mother said, you only needed to wipe
clean with a damp cloth and remove the stem
and blossom end. It was not necessary to cut
them, just put them into the saucepan and
nearly cover them with cold water.</p>

<p>Standing the saucepan over the fire, Adelaide
put on the cover and let the apples cook slowly
until very soft, stirring occasionally to keep
from burning, then she poured them into the
jelly bag and let the juice drip over night. In
the morning she measured the juice, and for
each cup of juice she measured a cup of sugar.
The sugar was put in an earthenware dish and
stood at the back of the range, to heat through,
but not brown, while the juice was boiling
rapidly for twenty minutes.</p>

<p>As soon as the juice was ready, Adelaide
added the sugar gradually, stirring constantly
with the wooden spoon until it had all dissolved.
This she let come to the "jelly point," skimmed
quickly, poured into a pitcher, and filled the
sterilized small glasses at once.</p>

<p>Next she placed the jelly in a sunny window.
When cold, she wiped each glass around the top
and on the outside with a damp cloth, poured
melted paraffin over the jelly (shaking gently
from side to side to exclude all air), pasted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the labels and stored away in the preserve
closet.</p>


<h3>Barberry Jelly</h3>


<div class="center">

<td align="right">2 tablespoons</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Mother saw to it that the barberries were
bought just before any frost came, and she
liked a few of the berries to be green. The
reason for this, she told Adelaide, was to make
the jelly firmer and a much better color.</p>

<p>Adelaide poured the barberries into the colander,
and dipped them up and down several
times in a pan of clear cold water, to rinse off
all dust, then she picked them over and put
them into the saucepan with two tablespoons of
cold water; next she mashed the barberries
with the wooden potato masher and placed
over the fire to cook slowly until very soft. It
was necessary, Adelaide found, to stir with
the wooden spoon occasionally to prevent
burning.</p>

<p>When the fruit was done, she poured it into
the jelly bag and the juice dripped over night.
In the morning she measured the juice, and for
each cup she measured an equal amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
sugar, which she put in an earthenware dish and
stood on the back of the stove to heat through,
but not brown, while the juice boiled rapidly
for twenty minutes. At the end of that time
Adelaide added the sugar gradually, stirring
constantly until it was all dissolved, then she
let it cook to the "jelly point."</p>

<p>Skimming the jelly quickly, she poured the
jelly into a pitcher and filled the sterilized small
glasses at once. They were then placed in a
sunny window, and, when cold, Adelaide wiped
around the top and the outside of each glass
with a damp cloth, poured melted paraffin over
the jelly, and shook it gently from side to side
to exclude all air. Before storing the glasses
away in the preserve closet Adelaide pasted on
the labels.</p>


<h3>Quince Jelly</h3>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>Quinces are very hard to cut, so Adelaide
found it necessary to use the little sharp knife,
after washing and wiping them thoroughly.</p>

<p>In preparing these, Adelaide removed the blossom
ends and seeds, cut each quince into small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
pieces, nearly covered the fruit with cold water,
placed the saucepan on the fire and let the
quinces cook very slowly until soft, stirring occasionally
with the wooden spoon to prevent
burning.</p>

<p>As soon as they had finished cooking she
poured the fruit into the jelly bag and let it
drip over night. Next morning she measured
the juice, and for each cup Adelaide measured
an equal quantity of sugar. The sugar she
stood at the back of the range in an earthenware
dish to heat through, but not brown, and
the juice she let boil rapidly for twenty minutes.
Then she added the sugar gradually, stirring
constantly until all the sugar had dissolved.
When the "jelly point" was reached Adelaide
skimmed quickly and poured the jelly into a
pitcher. Filling the sterilized small glasses at
once, she then stood them in a sunny window.</p>

<p>When cold, each glass was carefully wiped
with a damp cloth around the top and on the
outside, melted paraffin was poured over the
jelly, the glass was shaken gently from side to
side to exclude all air, and, finally, Adelaide
pasted on the labels and stored the glasses away
in the preserve closet.</p>

</table></div>

<p>The apples and quinces Adelaide wiped thoroughly
clean with a damp cloth, and removed
the stems and blossom ends. The apples she
cut into quarters, but the quinces were cut into
very small pieces. When she emptied the fruit
into the saucepan she nearly covered it with cold
water, then stood it over the fire, put on the
cover and let it boil gently until very soft. Occasionally
Adelaide stirred it with the wooden
spoon to prevent burning.</p>

<p>As soon as the fruit was sufficiently soft she
poured it into the jelly bag, where it remained
over night to drip. In the morning she measured
the juice, and to each cup she measured
an equal quantity of sugar, which she put at
the back of the range in an earthenware dish to
heat through, but not brown.</p>

<p>The juice then boiled for twenty minutes, at
the end of which time Adelaide added the sugar
gradually, stirring constantly until all had dissolved.
When the juice and sugar reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
"jelly point" Adelaide skimmed quickly, poured
the jelly into a pitcher, filled the sterilized
small glasses at once and stood them in a sunny
window.</p>

<p>Each glass was carefully wiped with a damp
cloth around the top and on the outside when
they were cold and melted paraffin poured over
the jelly. This Adelaide shook gently from side
to side to exclude all air. Next she pasted on
the labels, then stored the tumblers away in the
preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Cranberry Jelly</h3>

</table></div>

<p>After Adelaide had emptied the cranberries
into the colander, then dipped them up and
down several times in a pan of clear cold water,
she picked them over.</p>

<p>While her little fingers worked quickly she
told mother the cranberries made her long for
Thanksgiving Day to come, and especially this
year, as she wanted <i>her</i> "cranberry jelly"
served with the turkey. Mother said she would
feel very proud to have it grace the "festive
board."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>When the cranberries were all in the saucepan,
Adelaide poured enough cold water over
the top so that she could see it easily among
the berries. Placing the saucepan over the fire,
the berries cooked slowly, and Adelaide used
the wooden potato masher with which to mash
them. She also stirred them occasionally to
keep them from burning.</p>

<p>When the fruit was soft, Adelaide poured the
cranberries into the jelly bag and the juice
dripped over night. In the morning she measured
to each cup of juice a cup of sugar. This
she stood at the back of the range in an earthenware
dish, to heat through but not brown.</p>

<p>Adelaide cooked the juice rapidly for twenty
minutes, then added the sugar gradually, stirred
constantly until the sugar was all dissolved,
and let it continue to cook until the "jelly
point" was reached.</p>

<p>Now she worked quickly, skimming the jelly,
pouring it into a pitcher and filling the sterilized
small glasses at once. These she stood in
a sunny window.</p>

<p>As soon as the jelly was cold she wiped
around the top and the outside of each glass
with a damp cloth, poured melted paraffin over
the top, shaking it gently from side to side to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>

the tumblers away in the preserve closet.</p>

<p>Adelaide tried the combination of cranberries
and apples which mother said made a very good
jelly.</p>

<p>After wiping the apples thoroughly with a

Adelaide placed in the colander, dipped
up and down several times in a pan of clear
cold water, set aside to drain, then picked them
over.</p>

<p>Putting the apples and cranberries into the
saucepan she nearly covered them with water,
placed them over the fire to cook slowly, stirred
occasionally with the wooden spoon, then when
they were very soft and mushy, Adelaide poured
the fruit into the jelly bag. The juice dripped
over night, and, in the morning, she measured
the juice. To each cup, Adelaide measured an
equal amount of sugar. The sugar was placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
at the back of the range in an earthenware

the sugar gradually, Adelaide stirred constantly
until it had all dissolved.</p>

<p>When the cooked juice and sugar reached the
"jelly point" she skimmed quickly, poured into
a pitcher, filled the sterilized small glasses at

jelly was cold, Adelaide wiped around the top
and outside of each glass with a damp cloth,
poured melted paraffin over the top, shook it
gently from side to side to exclude all air, pasted

<p>This finished the "jelly making."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>PRESERVING AND CANNING</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Mother</span>," questioned Adelaide, "what is
the difference between 'preserving' and 'canning'?"</p>

<p>"Well, dear, according to the cook books,
preserved fruits are cooked with from three-fourths
to an equal weight of sugar, while
canned fruits have only sufficient added to
sweeten. Some fruits are often canned without
sugar, as it is not the sugar that keeps the
fruit, but the perfect sterilization of fruit and
jars. Sterilizing, you remember, is the killing
of all germs by boiling."</p>

<p>"Some fruits I much prefer canning without
sugar, such as apples, peaches, blueberries and
rhubarb. When you open the jars in the winter
time and add the sugar as you need it the flavor
is almost like that of fresh fruit," answered
mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see, so that is why our peaches taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
so much better to me than anybody else's!"
exclaimed Adelaide.</p>

<p>Adelaide began with strawberries, but first
she read the "general rules" again that she had
written down in the beginning, because she did
not wish to make a single mistake.</p>


<h3>Canned Strawberries</h3>


<div class="center">

<tr><td align="left">Strawberries,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>

<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Emptying the berries into the colander she
dipped it up and down several times in a pan of
clear cold water, then let them drain thoroughly.
The berries were hulled, weighed, and put into
the saucepan, which she placed over the fire,
heating the fruit through very gradually. It
was better, mother said, to let them stand at
the back of the range until the juice began to
run, before bringing the berries to the boiling
point. These boiled slowly five minutes, and
then Adelaide added one-third their weight in
sugar. The sugar had been standing in an
earthenware dish at the back of the range, to
heat through, but not brown.</p>

<p>While Adelaide added the sugar very gradually
she stirred the fruit gently with the wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
spoon, and was very careful not to break the
berries.</p>

<p>It did not take long for the fruit and sugar
to come to the boiling point, and then Adelaide
filled to overflowing the sterilized pint jar at
once, inserted the silver knife between the jar
and fruit to let the air bubbles rise and break,
put on the new rubber smoothly, sealed quickly
and stood the jar upside down out of the way
of any draft.</p>

<p>The next morning she inspected the jar
carefully, to be sure it did not leak, then wiped
away all stickiness with a damp cloth, pasted on
the label and stored it away in the preserve
closet.</p>


<h3>Canned Raspberries</h3>

</table></div>

<p>Mother was delighted with this quart of raspberries,
they were just ripe enough, large, and
almost every one perfect. It did not take Adelaide
long to pick these over, and she could see
each center very easily. There wasn't a single
bug or worm.</p>

<p>She weighed the raspberries before putting
them in the colander to dip up and down several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
times in a pan of clear cold water. When they
had drained, she emptied the berries into the
saucepan and stood it on the back of the range
to let the juice run. She also placed a third of
their weight of sugar in an earthenware dish
at the back of the range, to heat through, but
not brown.</p>

<p>When the juice had run sufficiently, Adelaide
moved the saucepan forward, the berries came
slowly to the boiling point, and continued to
boil very slowly for five minutes. It was then
time to add the warm sugar, stirring very gently
while it dissolved. Adelaide was very careful
not to break the fruit. As soon as the fruit
boiled again it was ready to pour into the sterilized
pint jar.</p>

<p>Adelaide filled the jar to overflowing, inserted
a silver knife between the jar and the
berries to let all air bubbles come to the top and
break, put on the new rubber smoothly, sealed
quickly, then stood the jar upside down out of
the way of any draft.</p>

<p>In the morning she made sure that the jar
had not leaked, then with a damp cloth she
wiped away all stickiness, pasted on the label
and stored the jar away in the preserve closet.</p>

<p>Adelaide picked over the raspberries and currants
very carefully, washed and drained them
in the usual manner, but kept them separate.</p>

<p>The currants she placed in the saucepan and
mashed with the wooden potato masher. Next
she cooked them very slowly until the currants
looked white, then she strained them through
two thicknesses of cheese cloth. Returning the
juice to the saucepan, she added the sugar,
stirring until it was all dissolved, and let it boil
slowly twenty minutes, then she poured in the
raspberries carefully and boiled them three
minutes.</p>

<p>The sterilized pint jar Adelaide filled to overflowing
at once, inserted the silver knife to force
the air bubbles to the top, placed the new rubber
on smoothly, sealed quickly and stood upside
down out of the way of any draft.</p>

<p>In the morning she wiped off all stickiness

<p>Mother liked to have her cherries cut in halves
and the stones taken out, though she told Adelaide
many people preferred them canned whole.
Adelaide followed mother's way, so the large
ripe cherries she placed in the colander, and
washed thoroughly by dipping it up and down
several times in a pan of clear cold water.</p>

<p>Next she removed the stems, and cut the
cherries in halves with a silver knife, taking out
the stones. Then she weighed the fruit. If
they were tart, she used one-half their weight
of sugar, but if they were of the sweet variety,
she needed only one-third of their weight of
sugar.</p>

<p>The cherries and sugar Adelaide put in the
saucepan together and stood at the back of the
range to heat gradually. As the sugar began
to melt and the juice to run, she removed the
saucepan forward and stirred the fruit gently
with the wooden spoon. Adelaide was careful
not to break the halves, and boiled the cherries
slowly twenty minutes.</p>

<p>She filled the sterilized pint jar to overflowing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
inserted the silver knife to bring the air
bubbles to the top, placed the new rubber on
smoothly, sealed quickly and stood the jar upside
down out of the way of any draft.</p>

<p>In the morning she wiped off all stickiness
with a damp cloth, inspected the jar carefully
to see that it did not leak, pasted on the label

<p>These were great big blackberries, firm but
ripe, and Adelaide poured them into the colander.
She could not resist popping the biggest
one into her mouth, but mother told her
that that was a very bad practice to begin.
Adelaide sighed, but she realized mother was
right, so she stopped eating any more and proceeded
to wash the blackberries. She dipped
the colander up and down several times in a
pan of clear cold water, drained thoroughly,
then weighed the fruit. Weighing one-third
their weight of sugar, she put it in an earthenware
dish and placed it at the back of the range
to heat through, but not brown.</p>

<p>The saucepan containing the blackberries was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
also stood toward the back of the range until
the juice began to run, when it was moved forward,
and Adelaide watched it while it came
slowly to the boiling point.</p>

<p>For five minutes the berries boiled very slowly,
then the warm sugar was added a little at a time,
and Adelaide stirred gently with the wooden
spoon, being careful not to break the blackberries.</p>

<p>They were ready to put in the sterilized pint
jar as soon as they boiled up again. Adelaide
filled the jar to overflowing, inserted a silver
knife to bring all bubbles to the top,
placed on the new rubber smoothly, sealed
quickly, and stood the jar upside down, out of
the way of any draft. The next morning she
examined the jar carefully to see that it did not
leak, wiped off the stickiness with a damp cloth,
pasted on the label, then stored the jar away in

<p>The blueberries that mother bought were almost
as large as currants and they were firm
and dry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Adelaide picked them over carefully, put
them into the colander, which she placed in a
pan of clear cold water, dipping it up and down
several times to cleanse the berries thoroughly,
then set aside to drain. The berries were then
weighed, put into the saucepan and heated
gradually.</p>

<p>To each pound of berries Adelaide added
one-third of a pound of sugar, setting it in an
earthenware dish at the back of the range to
heat through, but not brown. When the berries
had boiled slowly for five minutes, Adelaide
added the sugar very gradually, stirring gently
until it had all dissolved. The fruit was ready
to can as soon as it boiled up again, and at
once Adelaide filled to overflowing the sterilized
pint jar. She inserted a silver knife between
the fruit and the sides of the jar to bring
all air bubbles to the top, then placed the new
rubber on smoothly, sealed quickly and stood
the jar upside down out of the way of any draft.</p>

<p>In the morning Adelaide removed all stickiness

</table></div>

<p>Mother let Adelaide put up a jar of blueberries
without sugar. They made delicious
pies in the winter.</p>

<p>Adelaide picked over the berries carefully
into the colander, then she dipped it up and
down several times in a pan of clear cold water
to cleanse them from all dust. After they had
drained thoroughly, Adelaide poured them into
the saucepan, with two tablespoons of cold
water (this was to prevent burning), then she
placed the saucepan over the fire and let the
berries heat through very gradually. It was
necessary to stir occasionally with the wooden
spoon. They needed to boil but a minute or
two, as they had softened sufficiently while
heating through.</p>

<p>As soon as they were done, Adelaide filled the
sterilized pint jar to overflowing, inserted a
silver knife to let all air bubbles rise to the top,
then break, placed the new rubber on smoothly,
sealed quickly and stood it upside down out of
the way of any draft.</p>

<p>After inspecting the jar next morning to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
sure it did not leak, she wiped it carefully with
a damp cloth to remove all stickiness, pasted on
the label and stored the finished product away
in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Canned Peaches No. 1</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">

<td align="right">2 cups</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>There were three different ways mother told
Adelaide that she might put up peaches, two
ways with sugar and one without. Adelaide
put up a dozen peaches at a time.</p>

<p>The first dozen Adelaide placed in a pan and
covered with boiling water and let them stand
a few minutes. It was then easy for her to remove
the skins with a silver knife, cut in halves
and take out the stones. The peaches were
large, and mother said they should fill two pint
jars. So Adelaide washed and sterilized two jars.
Into a saucepan Adelaide measured two cups of
water and one cup of sugar, which she placed over
the fire and let boil ten minutes, then she dropped
the peaches in carefully and let them cook until
you could pierce them with a silver fork. When
they were done she lifted each half peach out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
with great care and put twelve of them in one
pint jar, and the remaining twelve in the other
pint jar. Next she filled the jars to overflowing
with the syrup, inserted a silver knife between
the fruit and the sides of the jars, to let
the air bubbles rise to the top and break, placed
new rubbers on smoothly, sealed quickly and
stood both jars upside down out of the way of
any draft.</p>

<p>The next morning she inspected them carefully
to see that they did not leak; then Adelaide
wiped off all stickiness with a damp cloth,
pasted on the labels and stored the jars away
in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Canned Peaches No. 2</h3>

</table></div>

<p>The second dozen of peaches Adelaide prepared
in the same manner. She placed them in
a pan, covered them with boiling water, let
them stand a few minutes, removed their skins
with a silver knife, cut them in halves, took out
the stones, then weighed the peaches. Placing
them carefully in the saucepan, Adelaide
poured over the peaches one-third of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
weight of sugar, and let them stand over night.</p>

<p>In the morning she added two cups of cold
water and stood the saucepan over the fire,
letting it come slowly to the boiling point.</p>

<p>From then on the peaches simmered slowly,
until they could be pierced easily with a silver
fork, Adelaide stirring occasionally in a careful
manner with a wooden spoon so as not to
break the fruit.</p>

<p>When they were sufficiently cooked, she picked
out the fruit with the fork, putting twelve
halves in each pint jar, filled them to overflowing
with the syrup, then inserted a silver knife
between the fruit and the jars to let all air
bubbles rise to the top and break, placed the
new rubbers on smoothly, sealed quickly, and
stood the jars upside down out of the way of
any draft.</p>

<p>In the morning she examined each jar carefully
to be sure they did not leak, wiped off all
stickiness with a damp cloth, pasted on the labels,
then stored the peaches away in the preserve
closet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>After Adelaide had covered the peaches with
boiling water and let them stand a few minutes,
she removed the skins with a silver knife, cut
them in halves, took out the stones and placed
them carefully in the saucepan.</p>

<p>To these she added two cups of cold water,
put the saucepan over the fire, let the peaches
heat through gradually, stirring occasionally
with the wooden spoon, and then boiled them
very gently for twenty minutes, or until they
could be pierced easily with a silver fork.</p>

<p>Lifting the peaches out carefully with a fork,
Adelaide put twelve halves in each sterilized
pint jar, and filled them to overflowing with the
juice.</p>

<p>Inserting a silver knife between the fruit and
the sides of the jars, she let the air bubbles rise
to the top and break. Next she placed the new
rubbers on smoothly, sealed quickly and stood
each jar upside down out of the way of any

<p>Next morning Adelaide examined each jar
carefully to be sure they did not leak, wiped off
all stickiness with a damp cloth, pasted on the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>


<h3>Canned Apricots</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Apricots,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td align="right">1&frac12; dozen</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water,</td>
<td align="right">1 cup</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The apricots are so much smaller than
peaches that one dozen, mother said, should
just fill a pint jar, but, to be on the safe side,
she would let Adelaide prepare eighteen.
Mother also said she was surprised that more
people did not can this fruit, it was of such a
rich and delicate flavor.</p>

<p>Adelaide washed and wiped each apricot
thoroughly, cut it in halves and removed the
stone. After weighing the apricots she put
them in the saucepan and added one-third their
weight in sugar and one cup of water.</p>

<p>Placing the saucepan over the fire, Adelaide
let the fruit come slowly to the boiling point,
stirring frequently with a wooden spoon to prevent
burning. After they had boiled gently
twenty minutes (Adelaide stirred all the time
being very careful not to break the apricots)
she filled the sterilized pint jar at once.</p>

<p>Adelaide picked the apricots out with a silver
fork and placed them in the jar first, then
she poured in the juice so that it overflowed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Using a silver knife, she inserted it between the
fruit and the jar, to let all air bubbles rise to
the top and break. Next she placed a new
rubber, which had been dipped in boiling water,
on the jar smoothly, sealed quickly and stood
the jar upside down out of the way of any draft.</p>

<p>In the morning the jar was carefully inspected
to see that it did not leak, and Adelaide
used a damp cloth to wipe away all stickiness.
After pasting on the label she stored the jar
away in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Canned Pears</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Pears,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td align="right">1 dozen</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Adelaide prepared a dozen large pears, although
mother said eight were quite sufficient
(if large) to fill a pint jar. It was not a good
plan to crowd such fruit as peaches, pears, and
apricots in too closely, because you might break
the fruit.</p>

<p>With the little sharp knife Adelaide peeled
the pears very thinly and cut them in halves,
removing the cores. The stems she left on.
After weighing the fruit, she placed it in the
saucepan and measured one cup of water to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
each pound of fruit. If the pears were tart,
she weighed one-half their weight of sugar; if
they were sweet she weighed only one-third their
weight of sugar.</p>

<p>The sugar was put in an earthenware dish at
the back of the range to heat through, but not
brown.</p>

<p>Placing the saucepan containing the pears
and water over the fire, Adelaide let them come
slowly to the boiling point. With the wooden
spoon she stirred them frequently, being careful
not to break the fruit. If, after twenty
minutes of gentle boiling, the pears were easily
pierced with a silver fork, Adelaide added the
warm sugar gradually and stirred carefully and
constantly until it boiled up again.</p>

<p>Into the sterilized pint jar Adelaide lifted
each half pear with a silver fork, then poured in
the juice until it overflowed. The inserting
of a silver knife between the fruit and the jar,
to let all the bubbles rise to the top and break,
was the next thing to be done, after which she
placed a new rubber smoothly on the jar, sealed
it quickly, then stood the jar upside down out
of the way of any draft.</p>

<p>In the morning Adelaide wiped off all stickiness
from the jar with a damp cloth, and examined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
it carefully to be sure that it did not leak.
Next she pasted on the labels and stored the
fruit away in the preserve closet.</p>

<p>Mother told Adelaide that some people found
pears a little too flat for their taste, and in that
case a tablespoon of lemon juice was added with
each dozen pears.</p>


<h3>Canned Crab Apples</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Crab Apples,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td align="right">1 dozen</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>These crab apples made one of the prettiest
jars Adelaide put up. She did not have to peel
the crab apples, just wash and wipe the fruit
thoroughly and remove the blossom ends. The
crab apples, of course, needed to be absolutely
perfect.</p>

<p>They were weighed, placed in the saucepan,
and a cup of water poured over to each pound
of fruit. One-half their weight of sugar Adelaide
placed in an earthenware dish at the back
of the range to warm through, but not brown.
The saucepan she placed on the fire and let
the crab apples and water come slowly to the
boiling point, stirring frequently with the
wooden spoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>When the crab apples could be pierced easily
with a silver fork Adelaide added the sugar
gradually and let the fruit boil up again. She
stirred constantly until they had boiled quietly
five minutes more, then she picked the crab
apples out with the silver fork and placed in
the sterilized pint jar.</p>

<p>With a silver knife, which she inserted between
fruit and jar, Adelaide let the air bubbles
rise to the top and break. The new rubber,
after being dipped in boiling water, was placed
on the jar smoothly, then she sealed it quickly
and stood it upside down out of the way of any
draft.</p>

<p>In the morning the jar was carefully inspected
for any possible leaks, and Adelaide
wiped off all stickiness with a damp cloth.
Next she pasted on the labels and stored the
canned fruit away in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Canned Quinces</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Quinces,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td align="right">&frac12; dozen</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Six large orange quinces (these are of the
best variety) Adelaide washed and wiped thoroughly,
peeled, cut into quarters, and removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the cores. After weighing the quinces she measured
into the saucepan one and one-third cups
of water to each pound of fruit.</p>

<p>Placing the saucepan over the fire she let the
water just boil, and then poured in the quinces.
They boiled gently for about twenty minutes,
or until you could pierce them easily with a
silver fork. Adelaide lifted these out very carefully
on to a large plate.</p>

<p>To the water in which the quinces had been
cooked, she added one-half their weight in sugar.
This she stirred with the wooden spoon until it
was all dissolved and the syrup boiled. The
quinces were gently dropped into the boiling
syrup (Adelaide took particular care not to
break the quarters) and when they had cooked
slowly for five minutes she filled the sterilized
pint jar with the fruit and poured the syrup
over it until it overflowed. Next she inserted
a silver knife between the fruit and the jar, to
let all air bubbles rise to the top and break.</p>

<p>The new rubber, after being dipped in boiling
water, was placed smoothly around the top,
then she sealed the jar quickly and stood it upside
down out of the way of any draft.</p>

<p>In the morning the jar was carefully examined
to be sure that it did not leak, and Adelaide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
wiped off all stickiness from the outside.
Pasting on the label she stored it away in the
preserve closet.</p>

<p>Mother had told Adelaide to save the peelings
and cores of the quinces, and put in a saucepan
with just enough water to cover. These
she let boil slowly for about one hour, then she
poured them into the jelly bag to drain off the
juice. This juice she used to cook her apples
in when she canned some the next day.</p>


<h3>Canned Apples</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Apples,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td align="right">1 dozen</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Quince juice</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>After washing and peeling the apples, Adelaide
cut them into quarters and removed the
cores.</p>

<p>The quince juice was made from the peelings
and cores of the quinces she had canned
the day before, by just covering them with cold
water and boiling slowly for one hour. Then
she drained them through the jelly bag.</p>

<p>To each pound of apples Adelaide measured
one and one-third cups of quince juice into the
saucepan, and she put one-fourth of their
weight of sugar into an earthenware dish, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
she stood at the back of the stove to warm but
not brown.</p>

<p>The saucepan containing the apples and
quince juice was placed over the fire, and the
fruit came slowly to the boiling point. Adelaide
stirred quite frequently with the wooden
spoon, being careful not to break the fruit.
When you could easily pierce the apples with
a silver fork, they were ready to have the warm
sugar added. This Adelaide poured in very
carefully and stirred until dissolved.</p>

<p>Five more minutes they needed to boil, being
stirred constantly, then Adelaide filled the sterilized
pint jar at once. First the fruit (lifted
out with a silver fork), then the syrup poured
in to overflowing, then the silver knife inserted
between fruit and jar, to let the air bubbles
rise to the top and break, then the new rubber
placed around the top smoothly, and lastly the
quick sealing. Adelaide stood the jar upside
down out of the way of any draft. In the morning
she wiped off all stickiness with a damp
cloth, from the outside of the jar, examined it
carefully to be sure that it didn't leak, pasted
on the label, then stored the jar away in the
preserve closet beside her steadily growing line
of preserves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The addition of the quince juice made the
flavor of the apples delicious.</p>


<h3>Canned Apples (without sugar)</h3>

</table></div>

<p>Wiping the apples clean, Adelaide pared them
with the sharp knife, cut them into quarters
and removed the core. If the apples were very
juicy she did not need to cook them in very
much water, otherwise the water (which she
poured over the apples <i>boiling</i>) came nearly
to the top of the apples.</p>

<p>Placing the saucepan over the fire, the fruit
boiled slowly until tender, then Adelaide at once
filled to overflowing the sterilized pint jar. Inserting
a silver knife between the jar and the
fruit, she let the air bubbles rise to the top and
break.</p>

<p>The new rubber, dipped in boiling water,
was placed on smoothly, and the jar sealed
quickly, then Adelaide stood it upside down out
of the way of any draft. In the morning she
wiped off all stickiness with a damp cloth from
the outside of the jar, inspected it carefully for
any possible leaks, pasted on the label and stored
the apples in the preserve closet.</p>

<td align="right">2 cups</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Mother had to show Adelaide how to remove
the skin and eyes from the pineapple. Adelaide
found it a rather prickly thing to handle,
but after it was ready, she cut it into slices
fairly thick, and removed the little hard core
with a sharp knife. Mother told her she could
leave the slices whole, or she could cut them
into cubes. Adelaide said that she preferred
cutting them into cubes.</p>

<p>The cup of sugar and two cups of water were
measured into the saucepan, which she placed
over the fire and let boil ten minutes, then the
pineapple was dropped in and cooked until
tender, or until you could pierce it easily with
a silver fork.</p>

<p>As soon as it had cooked sufficiently, Adelaide
filled the sterilized pint jar, first with the
fruit, and then poured in the syrup so that it
overflowed. Next she inserted a silver knife
between the pineapple and the jar, to let the
air bubbles rise to the top and break. The new
rubber, which had been dipped in boiling water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
was placed around the top smoothly, then Adelaide
sealed it quickly and stood the jar upside
down out of the way of any draft.</p>

<p>In the morning she wiped all stickiness off
the jar with a damp cloth, examined the jar
carefully to be sure there were no leaks, pasted
on the label and stored the canned fruit away
in the preserve closet.</p>

<p>Another way that mother liked to put up
pineapples is as follows:</p>


<h3>Canned Pineapples No. 2</h3>


<div class="center">

<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Adelaide, after removing the skin and eyes
from the pineapple, cut it into quarters lengthwise
and removed the cores. Then she weighed
it, after which she put the pineapple through
the meat chopper.</p>

<p>Into the saucepan she measured one-half its
weight of sugar and added the chopped pineapple.</p>

<p>Placing the saucepan over the fire, Adelaide
let the fruit and sugar come slowly to the boiling
point, stirring frequently with the wooden
spoon to keep from burning. After the boiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
point was reached, the fruit cooked slowly for
twenty minutes, and Adelaide put it into the
sterilized pint jar at once. The jar was filled
to overflowing and a silver knife inserted between
the fruit and the jar, to let all air bubbles
rise to the top and break.</p>

<p>Next she placed a new rubber around the top
smoothly, sealed it quickly and stood it upside
down out of the way of any draft.</p>

<p>In the morning she examined the jar carefully
to see that it did not leak, wiped off all
stickiness with a damp cloth, pasted on the label
and stored the finished product away in the
preserve closet.</p>

<p>Mother often used pineapple put up in this
manner for pineapple ice cream, or pineapple
sherbet. It made a delicious dessert.</p>


<h3>Canned Plums</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">

<td align="right">1&frac12; dozen</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The large blue plums, the green-gage plums,
or the large red plums, were all put up in the
same manner.</p>

<p>Adelaide wiped each plum thoroughly with a
damp cloth, cut it in halves with a silver knife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and removed the stone. Then she weighed them.
To each pound of fruit Adelaide measured one
cup of water and one cup of sugar. The plums
and the water she placed in the saucepan over
the fire and let them come slowly to the boiling
point, while the sugar was heating at the back
of the range in an earthenware dish.</p>

<p>Adelaide boiled the plums gently, stirring
occasionally with a wooden spoon, until they
were tender or until you could pierce them with
a silver fork easily. It usually took twenty
minutes. The sugar was then ready to add to
the fruit, and Adelaide stirred the mixture very
carefully until it was all dissolved. As soon as
the fruit boiled up Adelaide canned at once.
She lifted each plum carefully with a silver fork
into the sterilized pint jar, then poured in the
juice till it overflowed. Inserting a silver
knife between the fruit and the jar, Adelaide
let the air bubbles come to the top and break.
The new rubber, after being dipped in boiling
water, was fitted on smoothly, then she sealed
the jar quickly and stood it upside down out of
the way of any draft.</p>

<p>In the morning, with a damp cloth she wiped
off all stickiness from the outside of the jar,
inspected it carefully to be sure that it did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
leak, pasted on the label and stored the jar
away in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Canned Rhubarb</h3>

<tr><td align="left">Rhubarb,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td align="right">2&frac12; lbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>If the rhubarb is pretty in color and young
and tender, mother told Adelaide that she did
not need to peel the stalks, but just wash and
wipe them clean and cut them in small pieces
with the little sharp knife. Then she weighed
the fruit and allowed one-half pound of sugar
to each pound of rhubarb. Both sugar and
rhubarb were put in the saucepan and placed
over the fire to come very slowly to the boiling
point. Adelaide stirred constantly with a
wooden spoon to prevent burning, and as soon
as it had boiled fifteen minutes she poured it
into the sterilized pint jar. The silver knife
she inserted between the jar and the fruit, to
let all air bubbles rise to the top and break.
After the new rubber was dipped in boiling water
and placed over the jar smoothly, Adelaide
sealed it quickly, then stood the jar upside down
out of the way of any draft. In the morning
she inspected the jar carefully to be sure that
there were no leaks, wiped off all stickiness with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
a damp cloth, pasted on the label and stored
the jar away in the preserve closet.</p>

<p>Sometimes mother canned rhubarb without
sugar, so Adelaide tried a jar. Mother said
the flavor was much better and it was not so
juicy, also it was excellent for pies, shortcakes,
etc., adding the sugar when you used it.</p>


<h3>Canned Rhubarb (without sugar)</h3>

<p>Adelaide washed and wiped each stalk thoroughly,
then cut it into small pieces. These
she put in the saucepan with a tablespoon of
cold water to keep from burning, and stirred
with a wooden spoon. She let the fruit heat
very gradually and boiled slowly for fifteen
minutes. It was then ready to can, and Adelaide
poured the rhubarb into the sterilized pint
jar at once, after which she inserted a silver
knife between the jar and the fruit, to let all
air bubbles rise to the top and break. Next
came the new rubber, which she dipped in boiling
water, placed over the top smoothly, then
sealed quickly. Standing the jar upside down
she stood it out of the way of any draft. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
morning Adelaide examined the jar carefully
to be sure that it did not leak, wiped off the outside
with a damp cloth, pasted on the label and
stored the jar away in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Damson Plum Preserves</h3>

</table></div>

<p>The Damson plums Adelaide wiped thoroughly,
and pricked each one with a silver fork
twice. Then she weighed the fruit. To each
pound she measured three-quarters of a pound
of sugar. To each pound of sugar Adelaide
measured one cup of water. The sugar and
water she put in the saucepan and placed over
the fire. When the syrup boiled, Adelaide
skimmed it and added the plums. The plums
Adelaide cooked until they were tender, stirring
them carefully with a wooden spoon so as not
to break the fruit, then filled the sterilized pint
jar to overflowing. A silver knife was inserted
between the fruit and jar to let all air bubbles
rise to the top and break. The new rubber
was dipped in boiling water, placed over the top
smoothly and the jar sealed quickly. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Adelaide stood upside down out of the way of
any draft. In the morning the jar was carefully
examined to see that it did not leak, all
stickiness was wiped off with a damp cloth, the
label was pasted on, and then Adelaide stored
the jar away in the preserve closet.</p>

<p>The currants Adelaide picked over carefully
and put into the colander. This she placed in
a pan of clear cold water and dipped up and
down several times until quite clean. After
they had drained well she weighed them, and
to each pound of fruit she measured a pound of
sugar. Half of the currants Adelaide put in
the saucepan and placed on the fire to heat
through. When they were thoroughly warmed
she removed the saucepan from the fire and
mashed the currants with the wooden potato
masher, then she strained the juice through the
jelly bag.</p>

<p>The juice and sugar Adelaide put into the
saucepan and boiled gently for fifteen minutes,
after which she added the other half of the currants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
It took the currants only five minutes
to just cook through and they remained whole
in the jelly.</p>

<p>This was poured into sterilized tumblers.
When cold the tumblers were wiped free from
all stickiness, and Adelaide sealed them by pouring
melted paraffin over the top, shaking it
gently from side to side to exclude all air.
Pasting on the labels she stored them away in
the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Preserved Currants and Raspberries</h3>

<td align="right">1 quart</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The currants and raspberries Adelaide picked
over and kept separate. She did not forget to
look carefully in the center of each raspberry
to be sure that there were no little worms.
After washing the currants, placing them in
the colander and dipping it up and down several
times in a pan of clear cold water she poured
them into the saucepan and mashed them with
the wooden potato masher. Adelaide washed
the raspberries in the same manner, but stood
them aside to drain while the currants were cooking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
The currants simmered slowly for half
an hour (or until the currants looked white),
and then the juice was strained through the
jelly bag. Adelaide returned the juice to the
saucepan, and added the sugar. (The currants
and berries had been weighed after washing
them, and to each pound of fruit she measured
three-fourths of a pound of sugar.)</p>

<p>The juice and sugar boiled slowly for twenty
minutes, then Adelaide poured in the raspberries
carefully and cooked three minutes more.</p>

<p>Into the sterilized pint jar she skimmed the
raspberries, then added the juice to overflowing.
The silver knife was inserted between the jar
and the fruit, to let all air bubbles rise to the
top and break, the new rubber was placed on
smoothly and Adelaide sealed the jar quickly.
It was then placed upside down out of the way
of any draft. In the morning the jar was carefully
inspected for any leaks, wiped free from
all stickiness with a damp cloth and the label
pasted on. Adelaide then stored it away in
the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Preserved Strawberries</h3>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Before hulling the strawberries, Adelaide put
them into the colander and dipped it up and
down several times in a pan of clear cold water
to cleanse the berries thoroughly. After hulling
the fruit she weighed it, and for each pound
she weighed a pound of sugar.</p>

<p>The strawberries were put into the saucepan
and the sugar sprinkled over them and they
stood until the juice ran freely. Then the
saucepan was placed on the fire and the fruit
and sugar heated through. Adelaide stirred
with the wooden spoon, being careful not to
break the strawberries.</p>

<p>When the sugar was all dissolved and the
berries thoroughly heated, Adelaide skimmed
the berries out into a dish. The syrup then
boiled for ten minutes slowly, after which the
strawberries were dropped in carefully and
boiled two minutes. Into the sterilized pint
jar Adelaide skimmed all the berries, filled it
to overflowing with the syrup, inserted a silver
knife between the fruit and the jar to let all air
bubbles rise to the top and break, placed on the
new rubber smoothly, sealed the jar quickly and
stood it upside down out of the way of any
draft.</p>

<p>In the morning she examined the jar carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to see that it did not leak, wiped off all
stickiness with a damp cloth, pasted on the
label and stored the preserved berries away in
the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Preserved Blackberries</h3>

<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>After picking over the blackberries Adelaide
placed them in the colander and dipped it up
and down in a pan of clear cold water several
times to remove all dust and dirt. After
weighing the berries she poured them into a
saucepan and sprinkled over them an equal
weight of sugar. These stood for an hour before
Adelaide put the saucepan over the fire
and let the berries and sugar come slowly to the
boiling point. Adelaide stirred them gently
with a wooden spoon, being careful not to break
the fruit.</p>

<p>When they boiled up she skimmed out the
blackberries into a dish and the syrup cooked
for five minutes.</p>

<p>Returning the blackberries to the syrup she
put the saucepan at the back of the range and
let the fruit slowly heat without stirring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
After they had stood fifteen minutes she poured
the berries at once into the sterilized pint jar,
filling it to overflowing. With a silver knife,
which she inserted between the jar and the fruit,
she let all air bubbles rise to the top and break.
Placing a new rubber over the top smoothly
she sealed quickly and stood the jar upside
down out of the way of any draft. In the
morning it was ready to be inspected carefully
for any leaks, and she wiped off all stickiness
with a damp cloth, pasted on the label and
stored the fruit away in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Preserved Cherries</h3>

<tr><td align="left">Cherries,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td align="right">1 quart</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Adelaide washed the cherries in the colander,
which she dipped up and down several times in
a pan of clear cold water. She took off the
stems and removed the stones, weighed the
cherries and added a pound of sugar to each
pound of fruit. Then she let them stand over
night, and the next morning put them into the
saucepan to cook slowly until clear and tender,
stirring carefully with a wooden spoon so as
not to break the fruit.</p>

<p>When they were done Adelaide picked out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
cherries first with the skimmer and dropped
them into the sterilized pint jar, then she filled
it to overflowing with the syrup, inserted a silver
knife between the fruit and the jar to let all
air bubbles rise to the top and break, placed on
a new rubber smoothly, sealed quickly and stood
the jar upside down out of the way of any draft.</p>

<p>In the morning she inspected the jar carefully
to be sure that it did not leak, wiped off all
stickiness with a damp cloth, pasted on the label
and stored the jar away in the preserve closet.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Adelaide one morning, "it
is not nearly as discouraging to preserve as it
is to just plain cook."</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean, dear?" answered
mother.</p>

<p>"Well, I've been thinking how quickly we
eat up things you cook for us every day, while
my jams and jellies are still in the preserve
closet," mused Adelaide.</p>

<p>"Just wait until next winter, young lady,
then you'll see how quickly they will disappear,"
laughed mother.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<small>CONSERVES</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Adelaide came to "conserves," mother
told her she had only a very few recipes, but
that what they lacked in numbers they made up
for in quality.</p>

<p>"Have you the recipe for 'Peach conserve'?"
asked Adelaide anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, dear, that is our favorite, and I
don't know how many people have asked me
how to make it. I couldn't possibly keep house
without it," answered mother.</p>

<p>Conserves, mother explained to Adelaide,
were very similar to jams, with the addition of
lemon or orange juice, raisins and nuts.</p>


<h3>Rhubarb Conserve</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Rhubarb (cut up),&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td>
<td align="right">2 cups</td></tr>

<td align="right">1 dessert spoon</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Seedless raisins,</td>
<td align="right">&frac14; lb.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Walnut meats,</td>
<td align="right">&frac14; lb.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Mother picked out the pinkest, prettiest
rhubarb she could find, then Adelaide washed
and wiped each stalk and cut it into small
pieces. When she had filled the cup with rhubarb
twice she put it into the saucepan and
poured over it two cups of sugar and a dessert
spoon of lemon juice.</p>

<p>Adelaide next measured out a fourth of a
pound of seedless raisins. Upon these she
poured boiling water which stood a minute or
two, then she drained them. After looking
them over carefully to remove any stems, she
added them to the rhubarb, sugar, etc. Twelve
or fourteen large walnuts were sufficient to
crack. The meats Adelaide put through the
meat chopper and added to the rest of the good
things.</p>

<p>After standing three hours the saucepan was
placed on the fire and the conserve came slowly
to the boiling point. Adelaide stirred the mixture
frequently with a wooden spoon while it
boiled for twenty minutes. It was then ready
to pour into the sterilized tumblers.</p>

<p>When the conserve was cold, Adelaide wiped
around the top and the outside of each tumbler
with a damp cloth, poured melted paraffin
over the top (which she shook gently from side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to side to exclude all air), pasted on the labels
and stored the glasses away in the preserve
closet.</p>


<h3>Apricot Conserve</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Apricots,</td>
<td align="right">1 dozen</td></tr>

<td align="right">&frac14; lb.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Adelaide wiped the apricots thoroughly with
a damp cloth, then cut them in halves with a
silver knife and removed the stones. These
she placed in a saucepan, poured over them two
cups of sugar, a dessert spoon each of lemon
and orange juice, and the grated rind of half a
lemon and half an orange. Next she measured
out a fourth of a pound of seedless raisins and
covered them with boiling water for a few minutes,
after which she drained them and picked
off any stems. Twelve or fourteen large walnuts
were sufficient to crack, and the walnut
meats and the raisins Adelaide put through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the meat chopper, then added these to the fruit
in the saucepan.</p>

<p>Placing the saucepan over the fire she heated
it through slowly and let the fruit boil for forty
minutes. Adelaide stirred the contents of the
saucepan constantly with a wooden spoon, and
when it was done, poured it at once into the
sterilized tumblers.</p>

<p>As soon as it was cool she wiped the tops and
outsides with a damp cloth, poured melted
paraffin over the conserve, shaking the tumblers
from side to side to exclude all air, pasted on
the labels and stored the jars away in the preserve
closet.</p>


<h3>Peach Conserve</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">

<tr><td align="left">Seedless raisins,</td>
<td align="right">&frac14; lb.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Walnut meats,</td>
<td align="right">&frac14; lb.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>To remove the skins from the peaches easily,
Adelaide poured boiling water over them. Letting
them stand for a minute or two, she then
peeled off the skins with a silver knife and sliced
the peaches into small pieces, throwing away the
stones. Placing the peaches into a saucepan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
she added two cups of sugar. After weighing
out one-fourth of a pound of seedless raisins
she covered them with boiling water for about
a minute, drained, and picked off any stems.
The walnuts (twelve or fourteen large ones)
she cracked and put with the raisins.</p>

<p>The rind of the orange she grated over the
sugar and peaches, and then, after removing the
seeds, Adelaide put the pulp of the orange, the
raisins and the nuts through the meat chopper.</p>

<p>When everything was in the saucepan together,
Adelaide placed it over the fire and let
it come slowly to the boiling point, and then
cook gently for an hour. Adelaide stirred frequently
with a wooden spoon to prevent burning,
and when the conserve had cooked sufficiently
she poured it into the sterilized tumblers.</p>

<p>As soon as it was cold, she wiped around the
top and outside of each tumbler with a damp
cloth, poured melted paraffin over the conserve
(shaking it gently from side to side to exclude
all air), pasted on the labels and stored the
glasses away in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Plum Conserve</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Large blue plums,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td align="right">1 dozen</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">Seedless raisins,</td>
<td align="right">&frac14; lb.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Walnut meats,</td>
<td align="right">&frac14; lb.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>After washing and wiping the plums thoroughly,
Adelaide cut them in halves with a silver
knife, and removed the stones. Placing
them in the saucepan she poured two cups of
sugar and the grated rind of half an orange
over them. Twelve or fourteen large walnuts
were cracked and the meats taken out. Over
the quarter of a pound of raisins (which she
weighed) Adelaide poured boiling water. These
stood thus for about a minute, then she drained
off the water and picked out the stems.</p>

<p>The raisins, the walnut meats, and the pulp
of the half orange Adelaide put through the
meat chopper and added to the plums, etc. in
the saucepan. Placing the saucepan over the
fire she let the contents come slowly to the boiling
point, stirring it occasionally with the
wooden spoon. It cooked gently for one hour,
and then Adelaide poured the conserve at once
into the sterilized tumblers.</p>

<p>When it was cold the tops and outsides were
wiped off carefully with a damp cloth, melted
paraffin was poured over the top and shaken
gently from side to side to exclude all air, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
labels were pasted on and then the conserve was
stored away in the preserve closet.</p>

<p>The green-gage plums and the large red
plums would make an equally delicious conserve,
mother said, and she thought it would be nice
to substitute figs sometimes in place of raisins.
As the foregoing recipes were all she had, mother
told Adelaide that it was just as well to leave
further experimenting until another year. Adelaide
was very willing, as she was eager to try
"Spiced Fruits."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<small>SPICED FRUITS</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">When</span> you were a tiny little baby," said
mother, "I had a young girl living with me
who taught me how to put up Spiced Currants.
She had lived in the country, and her favorite
aunt was renowned for her tempting preserves."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother," interrupted Adelaide, "do you
think I could ever become renowned, or whatever
you called it?"</p>

<p>"I think there is no reason why you shouldn't,
if you continue to do as good work in the future
as you have thus far. Every year you
will become more expert, and find out many new
combinations that especially suit your taste
and appeal to others," answered mother. "All
spiced fruits," she continued, "are particularly
tasty when served with cold meats."</p>


<h3>Spiced Currants</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Currants,</td>

<tr><td align="left">Cinnamon (ground),&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td align="right">1 teaspoon</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Adelaide picked over the currants and removed
the stems. Putting the currants into
the colander, she dipped it up and down several
times in a pan of clear cold water, then set it
aside to drain. Into the saucepan she poured
the currants, added one pound of sugar, a half
a cup of vinegar, and a teaspoon each of cloves
and cinnamon.</p>

<p>Placing the saucepan over the fire, she let
the currants heat through gradually, stirring
occasionally with a wooden spoon, and when
thoroughly scalded she lifted out the currants
with a skimmer.</p>

<p>Adelaide boiled the juice until it thickened,
then added the currants again and let them just
boil up. They were then ready to put into the
sterilized pint jar, so Adelaide filled it to overflowing.
Next she inserted a silver knife between
the jar and the fruit, to let all air bubbles
rise to the top and break, placed a new rubber
on the jar smoothly, sealed quickly and stood
upside down out of the way of any draft.</p>

<p>In the morning the jar was examined carefully
to be sure it did not leak, all stickiness was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
wiped off with a damp cloth from the outside,
then the label was pasted on and Adelaide stored
the jar away in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Spiced Cherries</h3>

</table></div>

<p>Adelaide stemmed the cherries and washed
them in the colander by dipping it up and down
several times in a pan of clear cold water, after
which she stoned them. Into a saucepan she
measured one-half a cup of vinegar. To this
she added a third of an ounce each of whole
cloves and cinnamon tied up in a muslin bag.
The vinegar and spices Adelaide let boil gently
for fifteen minutes, then she added one pound
of sugar and boiled the mixture ten minutes
longer, stirring constantly with the wooden
spoon and skimming well. At the end of the
ten minutes Adelaide dropped in the cherries
and cooked the fruit gently for one-half hour.
Lifting out the cherries with a skimmer, she
put them into the sterilized pint jar, added the
juice to overflowing, and inserted a silver knife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
between the jar and the fruit to let all air bubbles
rise to the top and break. Then she placed
on a new rubber and sealed quickly, standing the
jar upside down out of the way of any draft.</p>

<p>The next morning, after carefully inspecting
the jar for any possible leaks, Adelaide wiped
off all stickiness from the outside with a damp
cloth, pasted on the label and stored the jar
away in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Spiced Gooseberries</h3>

</table></div>

<p>From the gooseberries Adelaide removed the
tops, then washed them in the colander, which
she placed in a pan of clear cold water and
dipped up and down several times. While these
drained, Adelaide measured the half cup of
vinegar and one and one-fourth pounds of
sugar into the saucepan. Placing the saucepan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
on the fire she brought the sugar and vinegar
to the boiling point, added the gooseberries,
then removed the saucepan from the fire.</p>

<p>The small piece of green ginger root she cut
into small pieces, the six whole cloves, the three
whole allspice, the bay leaf, the blade of mace,
and the piece of stick cinnamon were tied in a
small piece of muslin and added to the contents
of the saucepan. Covering the saucepan, it
was placed aside over night.</p>

<p>The next day Adelaide brought the fruit
quickly to the boiling point and cooked the
gooseberries gently until they were tender but
not broken. When they were done, she carefully
skimmed out the gooseberries and placed
them into the sterilized pint jar, then filled it to
overflowing with the syrup. Between the jar
and the fruit Adelaide inserted a silver knife,
to allow all air bubbles to rise to the top
and break. The new rubber was placed on
smoothly, and she sealed the jar quickly, standing
it upside down out of the way of any draft.</p>

<p>In the morning the jar was carefully wiped
with a damp cloth to remove all stickiness and
examined for any possible leaks. Next Adelaide
pasted on the label and stored the spiced
gooseberries away in the preserve closet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>


<h3>Spiced Pears</h3>

</table></div>

<p>Mother said she found that when she put up
"spiced pears" the year before that it took
fifteen pears of medium size to fill a quart jar,
so she told Adelaide to prepare eight pears.
Adelaide washed, wiped, pared, quartered and
removed the core from each pear.</p>

<p>The cup of sugar, half cup each of water
and vinegar, cinnamon stick and whole cloves
were put into the saucepan and placed over the
fire, then the teaspoon of mixed ground spices
was also added; the latter were tied in a small
piece of muslin.</p>

<p>These Adelaide let boil for five minutes, after
which she skimmed the syrup and added the
pears. It was necessary to boil the pears very
gently for thirty-five minutes, stirring them
frequently with the wooden spoon, but carefully
so as not to break the fruit. When they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
done Adelaide lifted the pears out carefully
with a silver fork into the sterilized pint jar,
and poured in the syrup to overflowing.</p>

<p>With a silver knife, which she inserted between
the fruit and jar, she let all air bubbles
rise to the top and break, then fitted on a new
rubber smoothly, sealed the jar quickly and
stood it upside down out of the way of any
draft. In the morning, after examining the jar
carefully to see that it did not leak, Adelaide
wiped off all stickiness with a damp cloth,
pasted on the label and stored the jar away in
the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Spiced Peaches</h3>

<p>Adelaide put the pound of brown sugar and
the cup of vinegar into the saucepan and added
the ground spices (clove, cinnamon, and allspice)
tied up in a small piece of muslin. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
saucepan she placed over the fire and let the
contents boil gently for ten minutes.</p>

<p>While the syrup was boiling, Adelaide poured
boiling water over the peaches, and after they
had stood a minute she peeled them with a silver
knife. Adelaide left the peaches whole, and
stuck four or five cloves in each peach.</p>

<p>As soon as the syrup had cooked sufficiently
she dropped the peaches in it and cooked them
until they could be pierced easily with a silver
fork.</p>

<p>The twelve peaches were enough to fill two
pint jars. Adelaide lifted the peaches out carefully
with the silver fork and placed them in the
sterilized jars. Then she filled the jars to overflowing
with the syrup. With a silver knife,
which she inserted between the fruit and the jar,
Adelaide let all air bubbles rise to the top and
break. Next, new rubbers were fitted on
smoothly and the jars sealed quickly, after
which she stood them upside down out of the
way of any draft. In the morning the stickiness
was wiped from each jar with a damp
cloth, they were carefully inspected to be sure
there were no leaks, then Adelaide pasted on

<p>One day when watermelons were in their prime
Adelaide's mother bought a part of one for
dessert. She told Adelaide to save all the rind
and the next day she would show her how to
make another tasty relish to be eaten with cold
meats.</p>

<p>In the morning Adelaide pared the rind neatly
and cut it into many attractive shapes. The
saucepan had been previously placed over the
fire, containing the pound of sugar, the cup of
vinegar, the piece of ginger root, the whole mace
and the bay leaves. The ground spices, one-half
teaspoon each of cinnamon and allspice,
and the one-third teaspoon of cloves, were tied
in a small piece of muslin and added to the
syrup. When the syrup reached the boiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
point Adelaide dropped in the watermelon rind,
and it was cooked slowly until perfectly tender.
Then Adelaide lifted out the rind very carefully
with a silver fork into a dish, covered, and
stood it away over night. The saucepan was
removed from the fire and placed aside to cool.
Next morning, Adelaide let the syrup again
come to the boiling point, and added the rind.
She watched carefully, and when it came to the
boiling point a second time she lifted the rind
carefully with a silver fork into the sterilized jar.
The syrup she poured in until it overflowed.</p>

<p>Inserting a silver knife between the jar and
the rind Adelaide let all air bubbles rise to the
top and break, then fitted the new rubber on
smoothly, sealed quickly and stood the jar upside
down out of the way of any draft.</p>

<p>In the morning Adelaide wiped off all stickiness
from the outside of the jar, examined it
carefully to be sure it did not leak, pasted on
the label and stored it away in the preserve
closet.</p>


<h3>Spiced Grapes</h3>

<p>Adelaide picked over and washed the grapes
by placing them in the colander and dipping it
up and down several times in a pan of clear
cold water. After draining thoroughly she
removed the skins and placed them in a dish
which she stood aside. The pulps were put
into the saucepan and cooked slowly until the
seeds could be removed by pressing the grapes
through a strainer.</p>

<p>The strained pulp, the skins, the pound of
sugar, the fourth of a cup of vinegar, and the
teaspoon each of ground cinnamon and cloves
(the spices were tied in a piece of muslin) were
all put in the saucepan together and cooked
until thick. Adelaide then filled the sterilized
jar with the fruit, inserted a silver knife between
the grapes and the jar to let the air
bubbles rise to the top and break, fitted on a
new rubber smoothly, sealed the jar quickly
and stood it upside down out of the way of any
draft. In the morning she inspected the jar
carefully to be sure that it did not leak, wiped
off all stickiness with a damp cloth, pasted on
the label and stored the jar away in the preserve
closet.</p>

<p>Adelaide put the pound of sugar, the half
cup of vinegar, and the teaspoon each of
ground cinnamon and cloves (the spices she
tied in a piece of muslin) into the saucepan
over the fire.</p>

<p>While the syrup was coming slowly to the
boiling point Adelaide picked over and washed
the blackberries by placing them in the colander,
which she dipped up and down several times in
a pan of clear cold water. After the blackberries
had drained well and the syrup had come
to the boiling point Adelaide added the blackberries.
These she let boil gently for fifteen
minutes, when she skimmed out the blackberries
and dropped them carefully into the sterilized
pint jar. Next she filled the jar to overflowing
with the syrup, inserted a silver knife between
the fruit and the jar to let all air bubbles rise
to the top and break, fitted on a new rubber
smoothly, sealed the jar quickly, and stood it
upside down out of the way of any draft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning Adelaide inspected the jar
carefully to see that it did not leak, wiped off
all stickiness from the outside with a damp
cloth, pasted on the label and stored the jar
away in the preserve closet.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said mother, "you may like to
try other fruits another year, preserved in
vinegar and sugar with spices, but I think for
the present the ones I have given you will do."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so too," replied Adelaide.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<small>PICKLES</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Adelaide</span> had never been allowed to eat many
pickles, because mother did not approve of them
for growing children, but an occasional sample
had made Adelaide look forward to the time
when she could have the same privilege as
"grown ups," to eat anything she liked. The
thought of preparing the pickles seemed to
Adelaide the next best thing to eating them.</p>

<p>"I hope when I put up 'pickled onions' I
don't cry," laughed Adelaide. "I can just remember
grandma peeling a great big pan of
onions and the tears rolling down her cheeks."</p>

<p>"Well, Adelaide," said mother, "if you will
peel your onions under running water you won't
need to waste any of your tears over them."</p>

<p>Mother said she would start Adelaide with the
small pickled beets, as they were not only a
general favorite, but exceedingly attractive
to look at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The vinegar used was the very best cider
vinegar, as it did not pay to use any other kind.</p>


<h3>Pickled Beets</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Beets (very small),&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>

<td align="right">&frac12; cup</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water,</td>
<td align="right">1 cup</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Mother ordered her beets from a market
gardener and he brought them to her fresh.
Mother always asked for the very, very small
ones.</p>

<p>Adelaide cooked the beets until she could
pierce them easily with a silver fork, plunged
them into cold water, peeled and filled two sterilized
pint jars. The half cup of vinegar, the
fourth cup of sugar, and the cup of water,
were put in a saucepan. Adelaide placed it
over the fire and let it come to the boiling
point.</p>

<p>After boiling the mixture for two minutes,
Adelaide filled the jars to overflowing with the
syrup. Inserting a silver knife between the
beets and the jar she let all air bubbles rise to
the top and break. To fit on a new rubber
smoothly, seal the jar quickly and stand it upside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
down out of the way of any draft, was the
work of but a moment.</p>

<p>The next morning Adelaide wiped the outside
of the jar with a damp cloth, examined it carefully
to see that it did not leak, pasted on the
label and stored the jar in the preserve closet.</p>


<h3>Pickled Onions No. 1</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Onions (very small),</td>
<td align="right">1 quart</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Salt,</td>

<td align="right">1 cup</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Mixed spices (whole),&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="right">&frac14; small package</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This recipe was one that had been given to
Adelaide's mother by a dear old friend. The
onions were just the common variety but
very small, not much larger than a good sized
cherry.</p>

<p>Adelaide poured boiling water on the onions,
as it made them easier to peel, then she let the
cold water run into the pan all the time she was
peeling them. This was to prevent her wasting
precious tears. The little sharp knife was
the best one to use.</p>

<p>A quart of onions does not sound very big,
but before Adelaide finished peeling them she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
thought she would never come to the end, there
seemed so many.</p>

<p>Into a large saucepan she measured two
quarts of cold water and one-half a cup of salt,
then added the onions.</p>

<p>These stood for twenty-four hours, covered,
after which she poured off the brine (mother
explained to Adelaide that that was what they
called the salt and water) and rinsed them by
pouring clear cold water on them.</p>

<p>After draining the onions well in the colander,
she filled two sterilized pint jars with the onions.</p>

<p>The cup of vinegar and fourth of a package
of whole mixed spices (the package was the
size that sold for ten cents before the war) were
put in a saucepan and simmered slowly on the
fire for one hour, after which Adelaide divided
the vinegar and spices equally between the two
jars and filled them to overflowing with cold
vinegar.</p>

<p>She inserted a silver knife between the onions
and the jars to let the air bubbles rise and break,
fitted on a new rubber smoothly, sealed quickly
and stood the jars upside down over night.</p>

<p>In the morning she wiped the jars thoroughly
with a damp cloth, inspected them carefully to
be sure that they did not leak, pasted on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
labels and stored the jars away in the preserve
closet.</p>

<p>Mother said these would need to stand a
month before they would be ready to be eaten.</p>

<td align="right">One blade</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The onions used in this recipe were what are
called the "silver skins" or little white button
onions.</p>

<p>After Adelaide poured boiling water on the
onions, so that she could peel them more easily,
she let the cold water run in the pan and peeled
the onions (with the little sharp knife) under
running water to prevent the tears from falling.</p>

<p>The onions she placed in a stone jar and
poured over a brine made of two quarts of boiling
water and one-half of a cup of salt.</p>

<p>These she covered and let stand over night.</p>

<p>The next morning Adelaide emptied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
onions into the colander, draining off the brine
and rinsing them in clear cold water.</p>

<p>Into a saucepan she poured enough vinegar
to cover the onions, added the dozen whole
cloves, the blade of mace and the bay leaf and
let them come slowly to the boiling point.
Then she added the onions and moved the saucepan
towards the back of the range to let it
stand for fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>At the end of that time Adelaide filled the
two sterilized pint jars with the onions, poured
over the hot vinegar and spices to overflowing,
inserted a silver knife between the onions and
the jar to let all air bubbles rise to the top and
break, fitted on the new rubbers smoothly,
sealed the jars quickly, then stood them upside
down over night.</p>

<p>In the morning they were inspected carefully
for any leaks, wiped off thoroughly with a damp
cloth and after the labels were pasted on, stored
away in the preserve closet.</p>

<p>Over the tomatoes and onions Adelaide
poured boiling water, then peeled them.</p>

<p>The red pepper she washed and wiped, cut
in halves, and removed the seeds. Through the
meat chopper she put the tomatoes, onions,
and pepper, then emptied them into a saucepan.</p>

<p>To these Adelaide added the tablespoon of
salt, the one and one-half teaspoons of ground
mixed spices, the half teaspoon of ground ginger,
the pound of brown sugar and the one and
one-half cups of vinegar.</p>

<p>Placing the saucepan over the fire she let
the contents come slowly to the boiling point,
stirring occasionally with the wooden spoon,
and stewed the mixture gently for one-half
hour.</p>

<p>It was then ready to pour into the sterilized
pint jars. These she filled to overflowing, inserted
a silver knife around the sides to let all
air bubbles rise to the top and break, fitted on
the new rubbers, sealed quickly and stood upside
down out of the way of any draft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning Adelaide looked the jars over
carefully to be sure they did not leak, wiped the
outside thoroughly with a damp cloth, pasted
on the labels, then stored the jars away in the
preserve closet.</p>

<p>Adelaide found that nearly everybody enjoyed
this "Chili Sauce" on Saturday night
with their beans.</p>

<p>Piccalilli was another general favorite, and
the recipe came from a friend who had experimented
with it a number of years so that now
she considered the flavor exactly right.</p>

<p>Adelaide washed and wiped the tomatoes and
peeled the onions. From the half of the green
pepper she removed the seeds.</p>

<p>Using an earthenware bowl Adelaide sliced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the tomatoes, onions and half pepper, and
arranged them in layers. Over each layer she
sprinkled salt (she was careful not to sprinkle
too much), then covered the bowl and let it
stand over night.</p>

<p>In the morning she drained off the water and
emptied the contents of the bowl into the saucepan.
Adelaide partly covered the tomatoes,
onions and half pepper with vinegar and added
sufficient cold water to just come to the top.
Then she added the fourth of a pound of brown
sugar and the fourth of a teaspoon of mixed
ground spices.</p>

<p>The saucepan was placed over the fire and
the ingredients Adelaide let boil for fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p>At the end of that time she filled the sterilized
pint jars to overflowing, inserted a silver
knife to let all air bubbles rise to the top and
break, fitted on the new rubbers smoothly,
sealed the jars quickly and stood them upside
down out of the way of any draft.</p>

<p>The next morning, after examining the jars
to be sure they did not leak, Adelaide wiped off

<p>The young lady who gave this recipe to
mother was a graduate of the college that leads
in the teaching of domestic science and was herself
a teacher at the time. Mother said it was
a nice change to eat with cold meats, only Adelaide
must be sure not to make the mistake she
did when she (mother) first made it.</p>

<p>"What was that?" asked Adelaide.</p>

<p>"Well, dear, I forgot to remove the seeds
from the peppers, and we nearly burned our
mouths, it was so hot," mother smilingly replied.</p>

<p>Washing and wiping the peppers Adelaide cut
them in halves and <i>removed every seed</i>.</p>

<p>She peeled the onions, then put the peppers
and onions through the meat chopper.</p>

<p>Placing these in a saucepan, she covered
them with boiling water and they stood for ten
minutes before putting over the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>They boiled for three minutes and then Adelaide
drained them in the wire strainer until
they were very dry.</p>

<p>Returning to the saucepan, she added the
tablespoon of salt, the cup of sugar and the
pint of vinegar.</p>

<p>After boiling all the ingredients together for
twenty minutes Adelaide filled the sterilized
pint jars to overflowing, inserted a silver knife
to let all air bubbles rise to the top and break,
fitted on new rubbers smoothly, sealed the jars
quickly and stood them upside down out of the
way of any draft.</p>

<p>In the morning she looked the jars over carefully
to be sure that they did not leak, wiped off
the outsides with a damp cloth, pasted on the
labels and stored the final results of her labor
away in the preserve closet.</p>

<p>Each tiny cucumber was washed and wiped
and placed in the saucepan. Adelaide covered
the onions with boiling water for a few minutes,
then let the cold water run into the pan while
she peeled them&mdash;if you peel onions under running
water you will not cry. These she added
to the cucumbers.</p>

<p>The cauliflower Adelaide stood in a pan of
cold water, to which she had added a handful of
salt (this mother explained was to draw out
any worms if there were any). Then she separated
the cauliflower into small flowers, cutting
off the thick stalk, and added to the cucumbers
and onions.</p>

<p>The green pepper was washed and wiped, cut
in halves and the seeds removed. It was then
put through the meat chopper and added to the
other vegetables.</p>

<p>Adelaide made a brine of one quart of water
and one-half of a cup of salt. This she poured
over the mixture of vegetables, covered and
stood for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>At the end of that time she placed the saucepan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
over the fire and let the contents heat

drain.</p>

<p>Mixing together the one-fourth cup of flour,
the one and one-half tablespoons of ground
English mustard, and the one-fourth tablespoon
of turmeric powder with enough cold vinegar
to make a smooth paste, Adelaide added
one-fourth of a cup of sugar and sufficient
vinegar to make one and one-fourth pints in
all.</p>

<p>This mixture she boiled until it thickened and
was smooth, stirring constantly with the wooden

<p>"You just wait, my dear, until Daddy finds
out you have put up this special recipe of
'Mustard Pickles' and you'll have to hide
them under lock and key, if you wish to keep
any," said mother.</p>

<p>"But I shan't tell him," laughed Adelaide.</p>

<p>"I'll put them away and then surprise him
next winter; perhaps I'll give him a jar for a
Christmas present."</p>

<p>So Adelaide smiled away to herself as she
busily prepared the vegetables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>The tiny cucumbers were washed and wiped
carefully and placed in a large earthenware bowl.
The cauliflower was placed in a pan of cold
water to which had been added a handful of salt
(this was to draw out any insects or little
worms that might be there), it was pulled apart
into small flowers, cutting off the thick stalk,
then added to the cucumbers. The celery was
thoroughly washed, the leaves and tough outside
stalks removed, the sticks cut into small
pieces about an inch long and added to the cucumbers
and cauliflower. The red and green
peppers were washed and wiped and the seeds
removed, then Adelaide put them through the
meat chopper and used the seeds of one-eighth
of one pepper. These were placed in the bowl
and mixed with the other vegetables.</p>

<p>Over the little button onions or silver skins,
Adelaide poured boiling water, then removed
the skins under running water (to prevent her
from crying) and poured them into the bowl.</p>

<p>After a brine of two and one-half quarts of
cold water and a cup and a quarter of salt was
made, it was poured over the vegetables and
stood over night.</p>

<p>In the morning the vegetables were well
drained in the colander and one and three-fourths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
quarts of vinegar was brought to the
boiling point.</p>

<p>Adding the pickles, Adelaide let them cook
until they were perfectly tender, next she added
one and one-fourth cups of sugar and two teaspoons
of celery seed.</p>

<p>Mixing together one-fourth of a pound of
English mustard, one-fourth of an ounce of
turmeric powder and three-eighths of a cup of
flour with one cup of vinegar (added gradually
so that it made a smooth paste) Adelaide poured
this over the pickles and stirred with the wooden
spoon until it just thickened.</p>

<p>The sterilized jars were filled at once to overflowing,
the silver knife inserted to let all air
bubbles rise to the top and break, and the new
rubbers fitted on smoothly. Sealing them
quickly, Adelaide stood the jars upside down
out of the way of any draft.</p>

<p>The next morning, after carefully inspecting
each jar to see that it did not leak, she wiped
off the outsides with a damp cloth, pasted on
the labels and stored away in the preserve closet.</p>

<p>Adelaide washed and wiped the cucumbers,
cut them in quarters lengthwise and each quarter
in halves. These she weighed, then placed
in an earthenware bowl and covered with a weak
brine made of one quart of cold water and one
tablespoon of salt.</p>

<p>After allowing them to stand for twelve hours,
she rinsed the cucumbers thoroughly in several
waters, then steamed them for twenty minutes.
Putting the two-thirds of a cup of vinegar, the
two cups of sugar, the teaspoon of whole cloves
and the stick of cinnamon (broken in small
pieces) into a saucepan, Adelaide boiled them
for five minutes; adding the cucumbers she let
them simmer for twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Removing the saucepan, she covered it and
stood it away until the next day, when she lifted
out the cucumbers with a silver fork and placed
them in the sterilized pint jars. The syrup she
boiled for five minutes, then poured at once into
the jars so that it overflowed. Next she inserted
the silver knife to let all air bubbles rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>

mustard, the one-half teaspoon each of ground
cinnamon, allspice, and cloves, and the one and
one-half teaspoons of white mustard seed were
placed in a saucepan and heated to the boiling
point, after which Adelaide added the tomatoes,
onion, and pepper, cooking them slowly for
fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>She next filled the sterilized pint jar to overflowing,
inserted a silver knife to let all air

<p>When Adelaide had washed and wiped the
tomatoes she cut them into quarters.</p>

<p>The small button onions she peeled under
running water. The tiny cucumbers were
washed and wiped, then cut in halves. The
cauliflower was placed in a pan of cold water.
She added one tablespoon of salt (this drew out
any insects or small worms that might be there),
then she broke off twelve small pieces. The two
white stalks of celery she washed and cut into
inch pieces. The string beans were washed,
wiped, the strings removed and each bean cut
into small pieces.</p>

<p>All these Adelaide placed in a large earthenware

was to draw out any insects or worms that are
sometimes found among the leaves. After
draining the cabbage she cut it into fine strips.</p>

<p>The red pepper she wiped, removed the seed,

then placed them in an earthenware bowl.
These she covered with one quart of water and
one-fourth of a cup of salt and let them stand
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>At the end of this time Adelaide took out the
cucumbers, wiped each one, and placed them in
the sterilized pint jar. Measuring enough
vinegar to fill the jar, Adelaide poured it into a
saucepan, then added one slice of onion, a teaspoon

<p>As soon as the vinegar boiled Adelaide poured
it over the cucumbers at once. Next she inserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
a silver knife in the jar to force all air
bubbles to the top, fitted on a new rubber,

<p>Dropping them carefully into the syrup,
Adelaide let the tomatoes simmer gently until
they could be pierced easily with a silver fork.
Taking care not to break the fruit, she lifted
the tomatoes into the sterilized jar and poured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
on the syrup to overflowing. After inserting

<p>Adelaide placed several large tomatoes in a
pan and covered them with boiling water. It
was then easy, she found, to remove the skins.
After cutting them into quarters, she put the
tomatoes into a saucepan and let them just
come to the boiling point. Removing the saucepan
from the fire, Adelaide poured the tomatoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
into the colander, pressed them through, and
then pressed them again through a sieve.</p>

<p>To one pint of pressed tomatoes Adelaide
added one-fourth of a cup of vinegar, one and
one-half teaspoons of salt, three-fourths of a
teaspoon of black pepper, one-eighth of a teaspoon
of cayenne pepper, three-fourths of a
teaspoon of dry mustard, and one-fourth of a
cup of brown sugar.</p>

<p>Adelaide boiled these ingredients together
until they thickened, then poured them into
bottles. She filled the bottles clear to the top
allowing just enough room for the cork, which
she pressed in tightly, then dipped the top of
the bottle into melted paraffin. After putting
on the label, Adelaide stored the jar away in
the preserve closet.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Adelaide one morning, "how
do you put up tomatoes? I mean ones like
those you use for tomato bisque and scalloped
tomatoes?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing simpler, my dear, and as
soon as those big beauties on Daddy's tomato
plants are ripe enough you shall have them for
your own," answered mother.</p>

<p>Adelaide watched those tomatoes every day,
and as soon as they were sufficiently ripe she
picked them.</p>

<p>Placing the tomatoes in a pan, she covered
them with boiling water for about a minute,
drained off the water, peeled them and cut them
into quarters. Adelaide let these come just
to the boiling point, then she filled the sterilized
pint jars at once. In filling the jars Adelaide
was careful not to let any of the little seeds
of the tomatoes remain on the rubber as they
might prevent the jar from being perfectly air-tight.</p>

<p>As usual, Adelaide inserted the silver knife
in the jar to let all air bubbles rise to the top
and break, fitted on new rubbers smoothly,
sealed the jar quickly and let it stand upside
down out of the way of any draft.</p>

<p>The next morning Adelaide examined the jar
thoroughly to be sure it did not leak, wiped off

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<small>CANNING THE GOVERNMENT<br />
WAY</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> in the summer a friend who was doing
government extension work in one of our New
England states sent Adelaide a book on "Home
Canning" that the government had published.</p>

<p>Adelaide was much pleased and she and
mother pored over it eagerly. Mother picked
out the "Single Period Cold-Pack" method as
being the simplest and best for a little girl.</p>

<p>This is what the government says&mdash;</p>

<p>"By the 'Single Period Cold-Pack' method
it is as easy to can vegetables as to can fruits.
The prepared vegetables or fruits are blanched
in boiling water or live steam, then quickly cold-dipped
and packed at once into hot jars and
sterilized in boiling water or by steam pressure.
The jars are then sealed, tested for leaks and
stored."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>The Single Period Cold-Pack method is a
simple and sure way of canning. It insures
a good color, texture and flavor to the vegetable
or fruit canned. In using this method sterilization
is completed in a single period, saving
time, fuel and labor. The simplicity of the
method commends it. Fruits are put up in
syrups. Vegetables require only salt for flavoring
and water to fill the container.</p>

<p>Another advantage is that it is practicable to
put up food in small as well as large quantities.</p>


<h3>Single Period Cold-Pack Equipment</h3>

<p><i>The Homemade Outfit.</i>&mdash;A serviceable Single
Period Cold-Pack canning outfit may be made
of equipment found in almost any household.
Any utensil large and deep enough to allow an
inch of water above jars, and having a closely
fitting cover, may be used for sterilizing. Into
this utensil should be placed a wire or wooden
rack to hold the jars off the bottom and to permit
circulation of water underneath the jars.
For lifting glass top jars use two buttonhooks
or a similar device. For lifting screw-top jars,
suitable lifters may be bought for a small sum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>


<h3>Containers</h3>

<p>For home use glass jars are more satisfactory
for canning. Glass jars properly cared
for will last for years. All types of jars which
seal readily may be used. Jars having glass
tops held in place by bails are especially easy
to handle while they are hot.</p>

<p>Tops for Economy jars must be purchased
new each year.</p>

<p>Small necked bottles can be used for holding
fruit juices. Large mouthed bottles can be
used for jams, marmalades and jellies.</p>


<h3>Tests for Jars and Rubbers</h3>

<p>Jars should be tested before they are used.
Some of the important tests are here given:</p>

<p><i>Glass-top Jars.</i>&mdash;Fit top to jar. If top
rocks when tapped it should not be used on that
jar. The top bail should not be too tight nor
too loose. If either too tight or too loose the
bail should be taken off and bent until it goes into
place with a light snap. All sharp edges on
top and jar should be filed or scraped off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Screw-top Jars.</i>&mdash;Use only enameled, lacquered
or vulcanized tops. Screw the top on
tightly without the rubber. If thumb nail can
be inserted between top and jar, the top is defective.
If the edge is only slightly uneven it
can be bent so that it is usable. Put on the rubber
and screw on the top tightly, and then pull
the rubber out. If the rubber returns to place
the top does not fit properly and should not be
used on that jar.</p>

<p><i>Rubbers.</i>&mdash;Be very particular about the
rubbers used. Buy new rubbers every year as
they deteriorate from one season to another.
It is always well to test rubbers when buying.
A good rubber will return to its original size
when stretched. When pinched it does not
crease. It should fit the neck of the jar snugly,
and be fairly wide and thick. It is cheaper to
discard a doubtful rubber than to lose a jar of
canned goods.</p>


<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>Vegetables and fruits should be sorted according
to color, size and ripeness. This is
called grading. It insures the best pack and
uniformity of flavor and texture to the canned
product, which is always desirable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>


<h3>Blanching and Cold-Dipping</h3>

<p>The most important steps in canning are the
preliminary steps of blanching, cold-dipping,
packing in hot, clean containers, adding hot
water at once, then immediately half sealing
jars and putting into the sterilizer. Spoilage
of products is nearly always due to carelessness
in one of these steps. Blanching is necessary
with all vegetables and many fruits. It insures
thorough cleansing and removes objectionable
odors and flavors and excess acids. It reduces
the bulk of greens and causes shrinkage of
fruits, increasing the quantity which may be
packed in a container, which saves storage
space.</p>

<p>Blanching consists of plunging the vegetables
or fruits into boiling water for a short time.
For doing this place them in a wire basket or
piece of cheesecloth. The blanching time varies
from one to fifteen minutes, as shown in the
time-table.</p>

<p>Spinach and other greens should not be
blanched in hot water. They must be blanched
in steam. To do this place them in a colander
and set this into a vessel which has a
tightly fitting cover. In this vessel there should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
be an inch or two of water, but the water must
not be allowed to touch the greens. Another
method is to suspend the greens in the closed
vessel above an inch or two of water. This may
be done in a wire basket or in cheesecloth. Allow
the water to boil in the closed vessel from
fifteen to twenty minutes.</p>

<p>When the blanching is complete remove the
vegetables or fruits from the boiling water or
steam and plunge them once or twice into cold
water. Do not allow them to stand in the cold
water. This latter process is the Cold Dip.
It hardens the pulp and sets the coloring matter
in the product.</p>


<h3>Steps in the Single Period Cold-Pack
Method</h3>

<p>In canning by the Single Period Cold-Pack
method it is important that careful attention
be given to each detail. Do not undertake
canning until you have familiarized yourself
with the various steps, which are as follows:</p>

<p>1. Vegetables should be canned as soon as
possible after being picked; the same day is
best. Early morning is the best time for gathering
them. Fruits should be as fresh as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Before starting work have on the stove
the boiler or other holder in which the sterilizing
is to be done, a pan of boiling water for use
in blanching and a kettle of boiling water for
use in filling jars of vegetables; or, if canning
fruits, the syrup to be used in filling the jars.
Arrange on this working table all necessary
equipment, including instructions.</p>

<p>3. Test jars and tops. All jars, rubbers
and tops should be clean and hot.</p>

<p>4. Wash and grade product according to
size and ripeness. (Cauliflower should be
soaked 1 hour in salted water, to remove insects
if any are present. Put berries into a
colander and wash, by allowing cold water to
flow over them, to prevent bruising.)</p>

<p>5. Prepare vegetable or fruit. Remove all
but an inch of the tops from beets, parsnips and
carrots and the strings from green beans. Pare
squash, remove seeds and cut in small pieces.
Large vegetables should be cut into pieces to
make close pack possible. The pits should be
removed from cherries, peaches and apricots.</p>

<p>6. Blanch in boiling water or steam as directed.</p>

<p>7. Cold-dip, but do not allow product to
stand in cold water at this or any other stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>8. Pack in hot jars which rest on hot cloths
or stand in a pan of hot water. Fill the jars
to within &frac14; to &frac12; inch of tops. (In canning
berries, to insure a close pack, put a 2 or 3
inch layer of berries on the bottom of the jar
and press down gently with a wooden spoon.
Continue in this manner with other layers until
jar is filled. Fruits cut in half should be arranged
with pit surface down.)</p>

<p>9. Add salt and boiling water to vegetables
to cover them. To fruits add hot syrup or
water.</p>

<p>10. Place wet rubber and top on jar.</p>

<p>11. With a bail-top jar adjust top bail only,
leaving lower bail or snap, free. With screw
top jar screw the top on lightly, using only the
thumb and little finger. (This partial sealing
makes it possible for steam generated within
the jar to escape, and prevents breakage.)</p>

<p>12. Place the jars on rack in boiler or other
sterilizer. If the home-made hot-water bath
outfit is used enough water should be in the
boiler to come at least one inch above the tops
of the jars, and the water, in boiling out, should
never be allowed to drop to the level of these
tops. In using the hot-water bath outfit, begin
to count sterilizing time when the water begins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
to boil. Water is at the boiling point
when it is jumping or rolling all over. Water
is not boiling when bubbles merely form on the
bottom or when they begin to rise to the top.
The water must be kept boiling all during the
period of sterilization.</p>

<p>13. Consult time table and at the end of the
required sterilizing period remove the jars from
the sterilizer. Place them on a wooden rack or
on several thicknesses of cloth to prevent breakage.
Complete the sealing of jars. With bail-top
jars this is done by pushing the snap down;
with screw-top jars by screwing cover on
tightly.</p>

<p>14. Turn the jars upside down as a test for
leakage and leave them in this position till cold.
Let them cool rapidly but be sure that no draft
reaches them as a draft will cause breakage.
(If there is any doubt that a bail-top jar is perfectly
sealed a simple test may be made by loosening
the top bail and lifting the jar by taking
hold of the top with the fingers. The internal
suction should hold the top tightly in place
when thus lifted. If the top comes off put on
a new wet rubber and sterilize 15 minutes longer
for fruits.) With screw-top jars try the tops
while the jars are cooling, or as soon as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
have cooled, and, if loose, tighten them by
screwing on more closely.</p>

<p>15. Wash and dry each jar, label and store.
If storage place is exposed to light, wrap each
jar in paper, preferably brown, as light will
fade the color of products canned in glass. The
boxes in which jars were bought affords a good
storage place.</p>


<h3>Caution Against Freezing</h3>

<p>Care should be taken to store canned vegetables
and fruits where they will be protected
from freezing. If the place of storage is not
frost-proof the jars should be moved to a
warmer place when the weather becomes severe.</p>

<h3><br />SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR
CANNING VEGETABLES</h3>

<p>The addition of 1 level teaspoonful of salt to
a jar of vegetables is for quart jars. For pint
jar use &frac12; teaspoonful. For 2 quart jar use 2
teaspoonfuls.</p>


<h3>Asparagus</h3>

<p>Wash, scrape off scales and tough skin.
With a string bind together enough for one jar.
Blanch tough ends from 5 to 10 minutes, then
turn so that the entire bundle is blanched 5
minutes longer. Cold-dip. Remove string.
Pack, with tip ends up. Add 1 teaspoonful of
salt and cover with boiling water. Put on rubber
top and adjust top bail or screw top on with
thumb and little finger. Sterilize 120 minutes
in hot-water bath. Remove, complete seal and
cool.</p>


<h3>Beets</h3>

<p>Use only small ones. Wash and cut off all
but an inch or two of root and leaves. Blanch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
5 minutes, cold-dip and scrape off skin and
stems. They may be packed in jar sliced or
whole. Add 1 teaspoonful of salt and cover
with boiling water. Put on rubber and top and
adjust top bail or screw top on with thumb and
little finger. Sterilize 90 minutes in hot-water
bath. Remove, complete seal and cool.</p>


<h3>Cabbage and Brussels Sprouts</h3>

<p>The method is the same as for cauliflower, except
that the vegetables are not soaked in salted
water. Blanch 5 to 10 minutes. Sterilize 120
minutes in hot-water bath.</p>


<h3>Carrots</h3>

<p>Select small, tender carrots. Leave an inch or
two of stems, wash, blanch 5 minutes and cold-dip.
Then remove skin and stems. Pack whole
or in slices, add 1 teaspoonful of salt and cover
with boiling water. Put on rubber and top and
adjust top bail or screw top on with thumb and
little finger. Sterilize 90 minutes in hot-water
bath. Remove, complete seal and cool.</p>


<h3>Cauliflower</h3>

<p>Wash and divide head into small pieces. Soak
in salted water 1 hour, which will remove insects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
if any are present. Blanch 3 minutes, cold-dip
and pack in jar. Add 1 teaspoonful of salt
and cover with boiling water. Put on rubber
and top and adjust top bail or screw top on with
thumb and little finger. Sterilize 60 minutes
in hot-water bath. Remove, complete seal and
cool.</p>


<h3>Corn</h3>

<p>Canning corn on the cob, except for exhibition
purposes, is a waste of space. For home
use remove the husks and silk, blanch tender
ears 5 minutes, older ears 10 minutes, cold-dip,
and cut from cob. Pack lightly to within &frac12;
inch of the top of the jar, as corn swells during
sterilization. Add 1 teaspoonful of salt and
cover with boiling water, put on rubber and top,
adjust top bail or screw top on with thumb and
little finger. Sterilize 180 minutes in hot-water
bath. Remove, complete seal and cool.</p>


<h3>Greens</h3>

<p>Wash until no dirt can be felt in the bottom
of the pan. Blanch in steam 15 minutes.
(Mineral matter is lost if blanched in water.)
Cold-dip, cut in small pieces and pack or pack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
whole. Do not pack too tightly. Add 1 teaspoonful
of salt to each jar and cover with
boiling water. Put on rubber and top and
adjust top bail or screw top on with thumb and
little finger. Sterilize 120 minutes in hot-water
bath. Remove, complete seal and cool.</p>


<h3>Lima Beans</h3>

<p>Shell. Blanch 5 to 10 minutes. Cold-dip,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>


<h3>Peas</h3>

<p>Those which are not fully grown are best for
canning. Shell, blanch 5 to 10 minutes and
cold-dip. Pack in jar, add 1 teaspoonful of
salt and cover with boiling water. If the jar is
packed too full some of the peas will break and
give a cloudy appearance to the liquid. Put
on rubber and top and adjust top bail or screw
top on with thumb and little finger. Sterilize
180 minutes in hot-water bath. Remove, complete
seal and cool.</p>


<h3>Peppers</h3>

<p>Wash, stem and remove seeds. Blanch 5 to
10 minutes, cold-dip and pack in jar. Add 1
teaspoonful of salt. Cover with boiling water,

bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>


<h3>Salsify</h3>

<p>Wash, blanch 5 minutes, cold-dip and scrape
off skin. It may be packed whole or in slices.
Add 1 teaspoonful of salt, and cover with boiling
water. Put on top and rubber and adjust
top bail or screw top on with thumb and little
finger. Sterilize 90 minutes in hot-water bath.
Remove, complete seal and cool.</p>


<h3>String Beans</h3>

<p>Wash and remove ends and strings and cut
into small pieces if desired. Blanch from 5
to 10 minutes, depending on age. Cold-dip,
pack immediately in jar, add 1 teaspoonful salt
and cover with boiling water. Put on rubber
and top and adjust top bail or screw top on
with thumb and little finger. Sterilize 120 minutes
in hot-water bath. Remove, complete seal
and cool.</p>


<h3>Summer Squash</h3>

<p>Pare, cut in slices or small pieces and blanch
10 minutes. Cold-dip, pack in jars, add 1 teaspoonful
of salt, cover with boiling water, put
on rubber and top and adjust top bail or screw
top on with thumb and little finger. Sterilize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
120 minutes in hot-water bath. Remove, complete
seal and cool.</p>


<h3>Tomatoes</h3>

<p>Take medium sized tomatoes. Wash them,
blanch until skins are loose, cold-dip and remove
the skins. Pack whole in jar, filling the spaces
with tomato pulp made by cooking large and
broken tomatoes until done and then straining
and adding 1 teaspoonful of salt to each quart
of the pulp. Put on rubber and top and adjust
top bail or screw top on with thumb and little
finger. Sterilize 22 minutes in hot-water bath.
Remove, complete seal and cool.</p>

<p>Tomatoes may be cut in pieces, packed
closely into jars and sterilized 25 minutes in
hot-water bath. If this is done do not add any
liquid.</p>


<h3>THE CANNING OF FRUITS</h3>

<p>For fruits, as well as for vegetables, the Single
Period Cold-Pack method is best. With some
exceptions, as shown in the table, fruits should
be blanched before canning. When fruits are
intended for table use, syrup should be poured
over them to fill the jars. In canning fruits to
be used for pie-filling or in cooking, where unsweetened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
fruits are desirable, boiling water is
used instead of syrup. When boiling water is
thus used the sterilization period in hot-water
bath is thirty minutes.</p>


<h3>Syrups</h3>

<p>In the directions given various grades of
syrup are mentioned. These syrups are made
as follows:</p>

<p>Thin&mdash;1 part sugar to 4 parts water.</p>

<p>Medium&mdash;1 part sugar to 2 parts water.</p>

<p>Thick&mdash;1 part sugar to 1 part water.</p>

<p>Boil the sugar and water until all the sugar
is dissolved.</p>

<p>Use thin syrup with sweet fruits. Use medium
syrup with sour fruits. Thick syrup is
used in candying and preserving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>


<h3>SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR
CANNING FRUITS</h3>


<h3><br />Apples</h3>

<p>Wash, pare, quarter or slice and drop into
weak salt water. Blanch 1&frac12; minutes, cold-dip,
pack into jar and cover with water or thin
syrup. Put on rubber and top and adjust top
bail or screw top on with thumb and little finger.
Sterilize for 20 minutes in hot-water bath.</p>

<p>Apples shrink during sterilization and for
this reason economy of space is obtained by
canning them in the form of sauce instead of
in quarters or slices. In canning sauce fill the
jars with the hot sauce and sterilize 12 minutes
in hot-water bath.</p>


<h3>Apricots</h3>

<p>Use only ripe fruit. Blanch 1 to 2 minutes.
Wash, cut in half and remove pit. Pack in jar
and cover with medium syrup. Put on rubber
and top and adjust top bail or screw top on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
with thumb and little finger. Sterilize 16 minutes
in hot-water bath. Remove, complete seal,
cool and store.</p>


<h3>Blackberries</h3>

<p>Wash, pack closely and cover with medium
syrup. Put on rubber and top and adjust
top bail or screw on top with thumb and little
finger. Sterilize 16 minutes in hot-water bath.
Remove, complete seal and cool.</p>


<h3>Blueberries<br />
Currants<br />
Loganberries<br />
Raspberries</h3>

<p>The method is the same as for blackberries.
Sterilize 16 minutes in hot-water bath.</p>


<h3>Cherries</h3>

<p>Cherries should be pitted before being canned.
Pack in jar and cover with medium syrup. Put
on rubber and top and adjust top bail or screw
on top with thumb and little finger. Sterilize
16 minutes in hot-water bath. Remove, complete
seal and cool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>


<h3>Pears</h3>

<p>Peel and drop into salt water to prevent discoloration.
Blanch 1&frac12; minutes. Pack in jar,
whole or in quarters, and cover with thin syrup.
Put on rubber and top and adjust top bail or
screw on top with thumb and little finger. Sterilize
20 minutes in hot-water bath. Remove,
complete seal and cool. A slice of lemon may
be added to the contents of each jar for flavor.</p>


<h3>Peaches</h3>

<p>Blanch in boiling water long enough to loosen
skins. Cold-dip and remove skins. Cut in half
and remove stones. Pack in jar and cover with
thin syrup. Put on rubber and top and adjust
top bail or screw on top with thumb and little
finger. If soft ripe, sterilize 16 minutes in hot-water
bath; if flesh is very firm, 25 minutes.
Remove, complete seal and cool.</p>

<p>Some peaches do not peel readily even if
dipped in boiling water. In such cases omit
dipping in boiling water and pare them.</p>


<h3>Plums</h3>

<p>Wash, pack in jar and cover with medium
syrup. Put on rubber and top and adjust top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
bail or screw on top with thumb and little finger.
Sterilize 16 minutes in hot-water bath. Remove,
complete seal and cool.</p>

<p>Pare, remove eyes, shred or cut into slices
or small pieces, blanch 3 to 5 minutes, and
pack in jar. Cover with medium syrup. Put
on rubber and top and adjust top bail or screw
on top with thumb and little finger. Sterilize
30 minutes in hot-water bath. Remove, complete
seal and cool.</p>


<h3>Quinces</h3>

<p>The method is the same as for apples. They
may be canned with apples. Sterilize 20 minutes
in hot-water bath.</p>


<h3>Rhubarb</h3>

<p>Wash and cut into short lengths. Cover
with boiling water or thin syrup. Put on rubber
and top and adjust top bail or screw on
top with thumb and little finger. Sterilize 20
minutes in hot-water bath. Remove, complete
seal and cool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>


<h3>Strawberries</h3>

<p>Wash and pack closely in jar. Cover with
medium syrup, put on rubber and top and
adjust top bail or screw on top with thumb and
little finger. Sterilize 16 minutes in hot-water
bath. Remove, complete seal and cool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>


<h3>PRINCIPLES OF JELLY MAKING</h3>

<p>To be satisfactory, jelly must be made from
fruit juice containing pectin and acid. Pectin
is a substance in the fruit which is soluble in hot
water and which, when cooked with sugar and
acid, gives, after cooling, the right consistency
to jelly.</p>

<p>Fruits to be used should be sound, just ripe
or slightly under-ripe, and gathered but a short
time. Wash them, remove stems and cut large
fruits into pieces. With juicy fruits add just
enough water to prevent burning while cooking.
In using fruits which are not juicy cover them
with water. Cook slowly until the fruits are
soft. Strain through a bag made of flannel or
two thicknesses of cheesecloth or similar
material.</p>


<h3>Test for Pectin</h3>

<p>To determine if the juice contains pectin, boil
1 tablespoonful and cool. To this add 1 tablespoonful
of grain alcohol and mix, gently rotating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the glass. Allow the mixture to cool.
If a solid mass&mdash;which is pectin&mdash;collects,
this indicates that in making jelly one part of
sugar should be used to one part of juice. If
the pectin collects in two or three masses, use
<small><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></small> to &frac34; as much sugar as juice. If it collects in
several small particles use &frac12; as much sugar as
juice. If the presence of pectin is not shown
as described it should be supplied by the addition
of the juice of slightly under-ripe fruits,
such as apples, currants, crab-apples, green
grapes, green gooseberries or wild cherries.</p>

<p>Measure the juice and sugar. The sugar may
be spread on a platter and heated. Do not let
it scorch. When the juice begins to boil add
the sugar. Boil rapidly. The jelly point is
reached when the juice drops as one mass from
the side of a spoon or when two drops run together
and fall as one from the side of the spoon.
Skim the juice, pour into sterilized glasses and
cool as quickly as possible. Currant and green
grape require 8 to 10 minutes' boiling to reach
the jelly point while all other juices require
from 20 to 30 minutes.</p>

<p>When the jelly is cold pour over the surface
a layer of hot paraffin. A toothpick run
around the edge while the paraffin is still hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
will give a better seal. Protect the paraffin
with a cover of metal or paper.</p>

<p>Three or more extractions of juice may be
made from fruit. When the first extraction
is well drained cover the pulp with water and
let it simmer 30 minutes. Drain, and test juice
for pectin. For the third extraction proceed in
the same manner. The juice resulting from the
second and third extractions may be combined.
If the third extraction shows much pectin a
fourth extraction may be made. The first pectin
test should be saved for comparison with the
others.</p>

<p>If the second, third or fourth extraction of
juice is found thinner than the first extraction,
boil it until it is as thick as the first; then add
the sugar called for.</p>


<h3>Jelly Making without Test</h3>

<p>The test for pectin is desirable, but it is not
essential. In some states it is inconvenient because
of the difficulty of obtaining grain alcohol.
A large percentage of housewives make
jelly without this test, and satisfactory results
may be obtained without it if care is taken to
follow directions and to use the right fruits. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the inexperienced jelly maker the safe rule is to
confine jelly making to the fruits which are
ideal for the purpose. These include currants,
sour apples, crab-apples, under-ripe grapes,
quinces, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries,
wild cherries, and green gooseberries. These
contain pectin and acid in sufficient quantities.</p>

<p>In making jelly without the alcohol test, with
the juice of currants and under-ripe grapes use
1 cup of sugar to 1 cup of juice. With raspberries,
blackberries, blueberries, sour apples,
crab-apples, quinces, wild cherries and green
gooseberries use &frac34; cup of sugar to 1 cup of
juice. This applies to the first extraction of
juice and to the later extractions when they
have been boiled to the consistency of the first
extraction.</p>

<p>Fruits which contain pectin but lack sufficient
acid are peach, pear, quince, sweet apple
and guava. With these acid may be added by
the use of juice of crab-apples or under-ripe
grapes.</p>

<p>Strawberries and cherries have acidity but
lack pectin. The pectin may be supplied by
the addition of the juice of crab-apples or
under-ripe grapes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>


<h3>Directions for Jelly Making</h3>

<p>Wash, remove stems, and with the larger fruits
cut into quarters. Put into a saucepan and
cover with water. Allow to simmer until the fruit
is tender. Put into a bag to drain. If desired,
test juice for pectin as described. Measure
juice and sugar in <i>proportions indicated by the
test for pectin or as directed under "Jelly Making
without Test."</i> Add the sugar when the
juice begins to boil. The sugar may be heated
before being added. When the boiling juice
reaches the jelly point, skim and pour into sterilized
glasses.</p>


<h3>Winter Jelly Making</h3>

<p>Fruit juices may be canned and made into
jelly as wanted during the winter. Allow 1
cup of sugar to 6 cups of juice. Boil juice and
sugar for 5 minutes. Pour into sterilized
bottles or jars. Put into hot-water bath, with
the water reaching to the neck of the containers.
Allow to simmer 20 to 30 minutes. If jars
are used half seal them during the simmering.
Put absorbent cotton into the necks of bottles
and when the bottles are taken from the bath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
put in corks, forcing the cotton into the neck.
Corks should first be boiled and dried to prevent
shrinking. They may also be boiled in paraffin
to make them air-tight. After corking the
bottles apply melted paraffin to the tops with
a brush, to make an air-tight seal. Each bottle
should be labeled and the label should specify
the amount of sugar used. In making jelly
from these juices during the winter follow the
"Directions for Jelly Making," adding enough
sugar to give the amount called for.</p>


<h3>FRUIT BUTTERS</h3>

<p>Fruit butters may be made from good sound
fruits or the sound portions of fruits which are
wormy or have been bruised. Wash, pare and
remove seeds if there are any. Cover with
water and cook 3 or 4 hours at a low temperature,
stirring often, until the mixture is of the
consistency of thick apple sauce. Add sugar to
taste when the boiling is two-thirds done. Spices
may be added to suit the taste when the boiling is
completed. If the pulp is coarse it should be
put through a wire sieve or colander. Pour the
butter into sterilized jar, put on rubber and
cover and adjust top bail. Put into a container<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
having a cover and false bottom. Pour
in an inch or so of water and sterilize quart jar
or smaller jar 5 minutes after the steam begins
to escape. Remove, push snap in place and
cool.</p>


<h3>Apple Butter with Cider</h3>

<p>Four quarts of sweet or sterilized cider should
be boiled down to 2 quarts. To this add 4
quarts of apples peeled and cut in small pieces.
If the texture of the apples is coarse they should
be boiled and put through a strainer before
being added to the cider. Boil this mixture
until the cider does not separate from the pulp.
When two-thirds done add one pound of sugar.
One-half teaspoonful each of cinnamon, allspice
and cloves may be added. Pour into
sterilized jars and sterilize 5 minutes in steam.</p>

<p>Apple and pear butter may be made by following
the directions for apple butter with cider
but omitting the cider.</p>


<h3>Peach Butter</h3>

<p>Dip peaches in boiling water long enough to
loosen the skins. Dip in cold water, peel and
stone them. Mash and cook them without adding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
any water. Add half as much sugar as
pulp and cook until thick. Pour into sterilized
jars and sterilize 5 minutes in steam.</p>

<p>Plum butter may be made following the directions
for peach butter.</p>


<h3>Apple Butter with Grape Juice</h3>

<p>To every 4 quarts of strained apple sauce
add 1 pint of grape juice, 1 cup of brown sugar
and &frac14; teaspoonful of salt. Cook slowly, stirring
often, until of the desired thickness. When
done stir in 1 teaspoonful of cinnamon, pack in
hot jars and sterilize 5 minutes in steam.</p>


<h3>Dried Peach Butter</h3>

<p>Soak dried peaches over night. Cook slowly
until tender. To each 2 pounds of dried
peaches add 1 quart of canned peaches and 1&frac34;
pounds of sugar. If a fine texture is desired,
strain pulp through a colander. Cook slowly,
stirring often, until thick. Pack in hot jars
and sterilize 5 minutes in steam.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<small>THE GOVERNMENT WAY OF
PRESERVING EGGS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A friend</span> hearing of Adelaide's "Preserving
efforts," said laughingly to the little girl, "I
hope, dear, you have not forgotten eggs."
"Oh, no," replied Adelaide, "we've already
done those. Mother ordered a whole crate of
thirty dozen and we preserved them in 'water
glass,' just as the government told us, although
we could have preserved them by the
'Lime Method' if we had wished."</p>

<p>The friend's face was a study, while Adelaide's
mother shook with silent laughter, exulting
at her little daughter's instant reply.
All unconsciously she had commanded a feeling
of profound respect, instead of the desire for
gentle teasing which the friend had at first intended.</p>

<p>"Suppose you read what the government
says about eggs," said mother, thus giving the
friend a chance to recover from her surprise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Adelaide at once went for her little "wooden
box," and this is what she read from its proper
card:</p>

<p>During the spring and early summer, when
eggs are abundant and reasonable in price, attention
should be given to preserving them for
winter use. Fresh eggs properly preserved may
be kept for 8 to 12 months in excellent condition
and used with good results.</p>

<p>Eggs laid during April, May, and early June
have been found to keep better than those laid
later in the season.</p>

<p>If satisfactory results are to be obtained, the
eggs should be <i>fresh</i> and <i>clean</i> and, if possible,
infertile. Eggs that float when placed in the
solution are not fresh and therefore cannot be
preserved. When an egg is only slightly soiled,
a cloth dampened with vinegar can be used to
remove such stains. Under no circumstances
should badly soiled eggs be used for preserving;
if put into the jar while dirty they will spoil,
and washing removes a protective coating which
prevents spoiling.</p>


<h3>Water-Glass Method</h3>

<p>A good method for the preservation of eggs is
the use of sodium silicate, or water glass. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the price of sodium silicate is about 30 cents a
quart, eggs may be preserved at a cost of approximately
2 cents a dozen. It is not desirable
to use the water-glass solution a second
time.</p>

<p>Use 1 quart of sodium silicate to 9 quarts of
water that has been boiled and cooled. Place
the mixture in a 5-gallon crock or jar. This
will be sufficient to preserve 15 dozen eggs and
will serve as a guide for the quantity needed to
preserve larger numbers of eggs.</p>

<p>(1) Select a 5-gallon crock and clean it
thoroughly, after which it should be scalded
and allowed to dry.</p>

<p>(2) Heat a quantity of water to the boiling
point and allow it to cool.</p>

<p>(3) When cool, measure out 9 quarts of
water, place it in the crock, and add 1 quart of
sodium silicate, stirring the mixture thoroughly.</p>

<p>(4) The eggs should be placed in the solution.
If sufficient eggs are not obtainable when
the solution is first made, additional eggs may
be added from time to time. Be very careful to
allow at least two inches of the solution to cover
the eggs at all times.</p>

<p>(5) Place the crock containing the preserved
eggs in a cool, dry place, well covered to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
evaporation. Waxed paper covered over and
tied around the top of the crock will answer this
purpose.</p>


<h3>Lime Method</h3>

<p>When water glass cannot be obtained, the following
method may be used in its stead. Many
consider this method entirely satisfactory,
though instances are known where eggs so preserved
have tasted slightly of lime.</p>

<p>Dissolve 2 or 3 pounds of unslaked lime in 5
gallons of water that has previously been boiled
and allowed to cool, and allow the mixture to
stand until the lime settles and the liquid is clear.
Place <i>clean</i>, <i>fresh</i> eggs in a clean earthenware
crock or jar and pour the clear limewater into
the vessel until the eggs are covered. At least
2 inches of the solution should cover the top
layer of eggs. Sometimes a pound of salt is
used with the lime, but experience has shown
that in general the lime without the salt is more
satisfactory.</p>


<h3>Using Preserved Eggs</h3>

<p>Fresh, clean eggs, properly preserved, can
be used satisfactorily for all purposes in cooking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
and for the table. When eggs preserved in
water glass are to be boiled, a small hole should
be made in the shell with a pin at the large end
before placing them in the water. This is done
to allow the air in the egg to escape when heated
so as to prevent cracking.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the friend, "I shall certainly
know where to come when I need any new
hints on preserving."</p>

<p>"When these recipes (touching the cards in
the little 'wooden box' lovingly) are made
into a little book&mdash;an idea that has been suggested
to mother&mdash;perhaps you could buy
one," suggested Adelaide innocently.</p>

<p>"I most certainly shall," answered the friend.</p>

<p>And she (the friend) did.</p>

<p>Jessie May could hardly wait for her copy
of the "little book," and you will be interested
to know that she was just as successful in her
efforts at "preserving" as was Adelaide, and
also found it very interesting work.</p>
